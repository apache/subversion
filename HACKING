Participating in the community
==============================

Although Subversion is originally sponsored and hosted by Collabnet
(http://www.collab.net), it's a true open-source project under a
BSD-style license.  A number of developers work for Collabnet, some
work for other large companies (such as RedHat), and many others are
simply excellent volunteers who are interested in building a better
version control system.

The community exists mainly through mailing lists and a Subversion
repository:

Go to http://subversion.tigris.org and

   *  Join the "dev", "svn", and "announce" mailing lists.
      The dev list, dev@subversion.tigris.org, is where almost all
      discussion takes place.  All questions should go there, though
      you might want to check the list archives first.  The "svn"
      list receives automated commit emails.

   *  Print out and digest the Spec.  (The postscript might look
      better than the PDF.)  The Spec will give you a theoretical
      overview of Subversion's design.

There are many ways to join the project, either by writing code, or by
testing and/or helping to manage the bug database.  If you'd like to
contribute, then look at:

   *  The bugs/issues database
      http://subversion.tigris.org/servlets/ProjectIssues

   *  The bite-sized tasks page
      http://subversion.tigris.org/project_tasks.html

To submit code, simply send your patches to dev@subversion.tigris.org.
No, wait, first read the rest of this file, _then_ start sending
patches to dev@subversion.tigris.org. :-)

To help manage the issues database, read over the issue summaries,
looking and testing for issues that are either invalid, or are
duplicates of other issues.  Both kinds are very common, the first
because bugs often get unknowingly fixed as side effects of other
changes in the code, and the second because people sometimes file an
issue without noticing that it has already been reported.  If you're
not sure about an issue, post a question to dev@subversion.tigris.org.
("Subversion: We're here to help you help us!")



Theory and documentation
========================

   1. DESIGN
      A design spec was written in June 2000, and is a bit out of
      date.  But it still gives a good theoretical introduction to the
      inner workings of the repository, and to Subversion's various
      layers.  Look in doc/programmer/design/, or look at one of the
      versions posted on the Subversion website.


   2. WEBDAV
      Greg Stein has written an introduction to Subversion's network
      protocol, which is an extended dialect of HTTP.  The document is
      'www/webdav-usage.html', and is also posted on the website.


   3. USER MANUAL
      We've started documenting some of the behavior of the client;
      it's only a small beginning, but it may help.  Look at
      doc/user/manual/ for this project.


   4. SYSTEM NOTES
      A lot of the design ideas for particular aspects of the system
      have been documented in individual files in the notes directory.



What to read
============

Before you can contribute code, you'll need to familiarize yourself
with the existing codebase and interfaces.

Check out a copy of Subversion (anonymously, if you don't yet have an
account with commit-access) -- so you can look at the codebase.

Within subversion/include/ are a bunch of header files with huge doc
comments.  If you read through these, you'll have a pretty good
understanding of the implementation details.  Here's a suggested
perusal order:

   *  the basic building blocks:  svn_string.h, svn_error.h, svn_types.h

   *  useful utilities:  svn_io.h, svn_path.h, svn_hash.h, svn_xml.h

   *  the critical interface:  svn_delta.h

   *  client-side interfaces:  svn_ra.h, svn_wc.h, svn_client.h

   *  the repository and versioned filesystem:  svn_repos.h svn_fs.h


Subversion tries to stay portable by using only ANSI/ISO C and by
using the Apache Portable Runtime (APR) library.  APR is the
portability layer used by the Apache httpd server, and more
information can be found at http://apr.apache.org.

Because Subversion depends so heavily on APR, it may be hard to
understand Subversion without first glancing over certain header files
in APR (look in apr/include/):

   *  memory pools:  apr_pools.h

   *  filesystem access:  apr_file_io.h

   *  hashes and arrays:  apr_hash.h, apr_tables.h


Subversion also tries to deliver reliable and secure software. This can
only be achieved by educating the developers on secure programming in
the C programming language. Please see 'notes/assurance.txt' for the
full rationale behind this.  Specifically, you should make it a point to
carefully read David Wheeler's Secure Programming (as mentioned in
'notes/assurance.txt'). If at any point you have questions about the
security implications of a change, you are urged to ask for review on
the developer mailinglist.

Coding Style
============

To understand how things work, read doc/svn-design.{texi,info,ps,pdf},
and read the header files, which tend to have thoroughly-commented
data structures.

We're using ANSI C, and following the GNU coding standards.  Emacs
users can just load svn-dev.el to get the right indentation behavior
(most source files here will load it automatically, if
`enable-local-eval' is set appropriately).

Read http://www.gnu.org/prep/standards.html for a full description of
the GNU coding standards; but here is a short example demonstrating
the most important formatting guidelines:

   char *                                     /* func type on own line */
   argblarg (char *arg1, int arg2)            /* func name on own line */
   {                                          /* first brace on own line */
     if ((some_very_long_condition && arg2)   /* indent 2 cols */
         || remaining_condition)              /* new line before operator */
       {                                      /* brace on own line, indent 2 */
         arg1 = some_func (arg1, arg2);       /* space before opening paren */
       }                                      /* close brace on own line */
     else
       {
         do                                   /* format do-while like this */
           {
             arg1 = another_func (arg1);
           }
           while (*arg1);
       }
   }

In general, be generous with parentheses even when you're sure about
the operator precedence, and be willing to add spaces and newlines to
avoid "code crunch".  Don't worry too much about vertical density;
it's more important to make code readable than to fit that extra line
on the screen.

The controversial GNU convention of putting a space between a function
name and its opening paren is optional in Subversion.  If you're
editing an area of code that already seems to have a consistent
preference about this, then just stick with that; otherwise, pick
whichever way you like.



Secure coding guidelines
========================

Just like almost any other programming language, C has undesireable
features which enables an attacker to make your program fail in
predictable ways, often to the attacker's benefit. The goal of these
guidelines is to make you aware of the pitfalls of C as they apply to
the Subversion project.  You are encouraged to keep these pitfalls in
mind when reviewing code of your peers, as even the most skilled and
paranoid programmers make occasional mistakes.

Input validation is the act of defining legal input and rejecting
everything else. The code must perform input validation on all untrusted
input. 


Security boundaries

A security boundary in the Subversion server code must be identified as
such as this enables auditors to quickly determine the quality of the
boundary.  Security boundaries exist where the running code has access
to information the user does not or where the code runs with priviliges
above those of the user making the request. Typical examples of such is
code that does access control or an application with the SUID bit set.

Functions which make calls to a security boundary must include
validation checks of the arguments passed. Functions which themselves
are security boundaries should audit the input received and alarm when
invoked with improper values. 

[### todo: need some examples from Subversion here...]


String operations

Use only the string functions provided in apr_strings.h.  These are
replacements for standard C library string functions, except safer
because they do bounds-checking and dest allocation automatically.
Although there may be circumstances where it's theoretically safe to
use plain C string functions (such as when you already know the
lengths of the source and dest), please use the APR functions anyway,
so the code is less brittle and more reviewable.


Password storage

Help users keep their passwords secret: When the client reads or writes
password locally, it should ensure that the file is mode 0600. If the
file is readable by other users, the client should exit with a message
that tells the user to change the filemode due to the risk of exposure.



Document everything
===================

Every function, whether public or internal, must start out with a
documentation comment that describes what the function does.  The
documentation should mention every parameter received by the function,
every possible return value, and (if not obvious) the conditions under
which the function could return an error.  Put the parameter names in
upper case in the doc string, even when they are not upper case in the
actual declaration, so that they stand out to human readers.

For public or semi-public API functions, the doc string should go
above the function in the .h file where it is declared; otherwise, it
goes above the function definition in the .c file.

For structure types, document each individual member of the structure
as well as the structure itself.

Read over the Subversion code to get an overview of how this
documentation looks in practice; in particular, use the .h files in
subversion/include/ as examples.



Using Page Breaks
=================

We're using page breaks (the Ctrl-L character, ASCII 12) for section
boundaries in both code and plaintext prose files.  This file is a
good example of how it's done: each section starts with a page break,
and the immediately after the page break comes the title of the
section.

This helps out people who use the Emacs page commands, such as
`pages-directory' and `narrow-to-page'.  Such people are not as scarce
as you might think, and if you'd like to become one of them, then type
C-x C-p C-h in Emacs sometime.



Other Conventions:
==================

In addition to the GNU standards, Subversion uses these conventions:

   *  Use only spaces for indenting code, never tabs.  Tab display
      width is not standardized enough, and anyway it's easier to
      manually adjust indentation that uses spaces.

   *  Stay within 80 columns, the width of a minimal standard display
      window.

   *  Signify internal variables by two underscores after the prefix.
      That is, when a symbol must (for technical reasons) reside in the
      global namespace despite not being part of a published interface,
      then use two underscores following the module prefix.  For
      example:

         svn_fs_get_rev_prop ()       /* Part of published API. */
         svn_fs__parse_props ()       /* For internal use only. */

   *  Put this comment at the bottom of new source files to make Emacs
      automatically load svn-dev.el:

         /*
          * local variables:
          * eval: (load-file "../../tools/dev/svn-dev.el")
          * end:
          */

      (This assumes the C file is located in a subdirectory of
      subversion/subversion/, which most are.)

   *  We have a tradition of not marking files with the names of
      individual authors (i.e., we don't put lines like "Author: foo"
      or "@author foo" in a special position at the top of a source
      file).  This is to discourage territoriality -- even when a file
      has only one author, we want to make sure others feel free to
      make changes.  People might be unnecessarily hesitant if someone
      appears to have staked ownership on the file.

   *  There are many other unspoken conventions maintained througout
      the code, that are only noticed when someone unintentionally
      fails to follow them.  Just try to have a sensitive eye for the
      way things are done, and when in doubt, ask.



APR Status Codes:
=================

Always check for APR status codes (except APR_SUCCESS) with the
APR_STATUS_IS_...() macros, not by direct comparison. This is
required for portability to non-Unix platforms.



Automated Tests:
================

For a description of how to use and add tests to Subversion's
automated test framework, please read subversion/tests/README.



Writing test cases before code:
===============================

From: Karl Fogel <kfogel@collab.net>
Subject: writing test cases
To: dev@subversion.tigris.org
Date: Mon, 5 Mar 2001 15:58:46 -0600

Many of us implementing the filesystem interface have now gotten into
the habit of writing the test cases (see fs-test.c) *before* writing
the actual code.  It's really helping us out a lot -- for one thing,
it forces one to define the task precisely in advance, and also it
speedily reveals the bugs in one's first try (and second, and
third...).

I'd like to recommend this practice to everyone.  If you're
implementing an interface, or adding an entirely new feature, or even
just fixing a bug, a test for it is a good idea.  And if you're going
to write the test anyway, you might as well write it first. :-)

Yoshiki Hayashi's been sending test cases with all his patches lately,
which is what inspired me to write this mail to encourage everyone to
do the same.  Having those test cases makes patches easier to examine,
because they show the patch's purpose very clearly.  It's like having
a second log message, one whose accuracy is verified at run-time.

That said, I don't think we want a rigid policy about this, at least
not yet.  If you encounter a bug somewhere in the code, but you only
have time to write a patch with no test case, that's okay -- having
the patch is still useful; someone else can write the test case.

As Subversion gets more complex, though, the automated test suite gets
more crucial, so let's all get in the habit of using it early.

-K



Debugging the server
====================

'mod_dav_svn.so' contains the main Subversion server logic; it runs as
a module within mod_dav, which runs as a module within httpd.  Since
httpd is probably using dynamic shared modules, you normally won't be
able to set breakpoints in advance when you start Apache in a debugger
such as GDB.  Instead, you'll need to start up, then interrupt httpd,
set your breakpoint, and continue:

   % gdb httpd
   (gdb) run -X
   ^C
   (gdb) break some_func_in_mod_dav_svn
   (gdb) continue

The -X switch is equivalent to -DONE_PROCESS and -DNO_DETACH, which
ensure that httpd runs as a single thread and remains attached to the
tty, respectively.  As soon as it starts, it sits and waits for
requests; that's when you hit control-C and set your breakpoint.

You'll probably want to watch Apache's run-time logs

   /usr/local/apache2/logs/error_log
   /usr/local/apache2/logs/access_log

to help determine what might be going wrong and where to set
breakpoints.



Writing Log Entries
===================

Certain guidelines should be adhered to when writing log messages:

Make a log entry for every change.  The value of the log becomes much
less if developers cannot rely on its completeness.  Even if you've
only changed comments, write an entry that says, "Doc fix."  The only
changes you needn't log are small changes that have no effect on the
source, like formatting tweaks.

Log entries should be full sentences, not sentence fragments.
Fragments are more often ambiguous, and it takes only a few more
seconds to write out what you mean.  Fragments like `New file' or `New
function' are acceptable, because they are standard idioms, and all
further details should appear in the source code.

The log entry should name every affected function, variable, macro,
makefile target, grammar rule, etc, including the names of symbols
that are being removed in this commit.  This helps people do automated
searches through the logs later.  Don't hide names in wildcards,
because the globbed portion may be what someone searches for later.
For example, this is bad:

   * twirl.c (twirling_baton_*): removed these obsolete structures.
   (handle_parser_warning): pass data directly to callees, instead of
   storing in twirling_baton_*.

   * twirl.h: Fix indentation.

Later on, when someone is trying to figure out what happened to
`twirling_baton_fast', they may not find it if they just search for
"_fast".  A better entry would be:

   * twirl.c (twirling_baton_fast, twirling_baton_slow): removed these
   obsolete structures.
   (handle_parser_warning): pass data directly to callees, instead of
   storing in twirling_baton_*.

   * twirl.h: Fix indentation.

The wildcard is okay in the description for `handle_parser_warning',
but only because the two structures were mentioned by full name
elsewhere in the log entry.

Note how each file is its own group, with the symbols listed in
parentheses, followed by a colon, followed by text describing the
change.  Please adhere to this format -- not only does consistency
greatly aid readability, it also allows software to colorize log
entries automatically.

If your change is related to a specific issue in the issue tracker,
then include a string like "issue #N" in the log message.  For
example, if a patch resolves issue 1729, then the log message might
be:

   Fix issue #1729:

   * get_editor.c (frobnicate_file): Check that file exists first.

For large changes or change groups, group the log entry into
paragraphs separated by blank lines.  Each paragraph should be a set
of changes that accomplishes a single goal, and each group should
start with a sentence or two summarizing the change.  Truly
independent changes should be made in separate commits, of course.

One should never need the log entries to understand the current code.
If you find yourself writing a significant explanation in the log, you
should consider carefully whether your text doesn't actually belong in
a comment, alongside the code it explains.  Here's an example of doing
it right:

   (consume_count): If `count' is unreasonable, return 0 and don't
   advance input pointer.

And then, in `consume_count' in `cplus-dem.c':

   while (isdigit ((unsigned char)**type))
     {
       count *= 10;
       count += **type - '0';
       /* A sanity check.  Otherwise a symbol like
         `_Utf390_1__1_9223372036854775807__9223372036854775'
         can cause this function to return a negative value.
         In this case we just consume until the end of the string.  */
      if (count > strlen (*type))
        {
          *type = save;
          return 0;
        }

This is why a new function, for example, needs only a log entry saying
"New Function" --- all the details should be in the source.

There are some common-sense exceptions to the need to name everything
that was changed:

   *  If you have made a change which requires trivial changes
      throughout the rest of the program (e.g., renaming a variable),
      you needn't name all the functions affected.

   *  If you have rewritten a file completely, the reader understands
      that everything in it has changed, so your log entry may simply
      give the file name, and say "Rewritten".

   *  If your change was only to one file, or was the same change to
      multiple files, then there's no need to list their paths in the
      log message (because "svn log" can show the changed paths for
      that revision anyway).  Only when you need to describe how the
      change affected different paths in different ways is it
      necessary to organize the log message by path, as in the
      examples above.

In general, there is a tension between making entries easy to find by
searching for identifiers, and wasting time or producing unreadable
entries by being exhaustive.  Use your best judgement --- and be
considerate of your fellow developers.  (Also, run "svn log" to see
how others have been writing their log entries.)



Patch submission guidelines
===========================

Mail patches to `dev@subversion.tigris.org', with a subject line
that contains the word "PATCH" in all uppercase, for example

   Subject: [PATCH] fix for rev printing bug in svn status

A patch submission should contain one logical change; please don't mix
N unrelated changes in one submission -- send N separate emails
instead.

The email message should start off with a log message, as described in
"Writing log entries" above.  The patch itself should be in unified
diff format, preferably inserted directly into the body of your
message (rather than MIME-attached, uuencoded, or otherwise
opaqified).  If your mailer wraps long lines, then you will need to
attach your patch.  Please ensure the MIME type of the attachment is
text/plain (some mailers allow you to set the MIME type; for some
others, you might have to use a .txt extension on your patch file). Do
not compress or otherwise encode the attached patch.

If the patch implements a new feature, make sure to describe the
feature completely in your mail; if the patch fixes a bug, describe
the bug in detail and give a reproduction recipe.  An exception to
these guidelines is when the patch addresses a specific issue in the
issues database -- in that case, just make sure to refer to the issue
number in your log message, as described in "Writing log entries".

It is normal for patches to undergo several rounds of feedback and
change before being applied.  Don't be discouraged if your patch is
not accepted immediately -- it doesn't mean you goofed, it just means
that there are a *lot* of eyes looking at every code submission, and
it's a rare patch that doesn't have at least a little room for
improvement.  After reading people's responses to your patch, make the
appropriate changes and resubmit, wait for the next round of feedback,
and lather, rinse, repeat, until some committer applies it.

If you don't get a response for a while, and don't see the patch
applied, it may just mean that people are really busy.  Go ahead and
repost, and don't hesitate to point out that you're still waiting for
a response.  One way to think of it is that patch management is highly
parallizable, and we need you to shoulder your share of the management
as well as the coding.  Every patch needs someone to shepherd it
through the process, and the person best qualified to do that is the
original submitter.



Commit access
=============

After someone has successfully contributed a few non-trivial patches,
some committer, usually whoever has reviewed and applied the most
patches from that contributor, proposes them for commit access.  This
proposal is sent only to the other full committers -- the ensuing
discussion is private, so that everyone can feel comfortable speaking
their minds.  Assuming there are no objections, the contributor is
granted commit access.  The decision is made by consensus; there are
no formal rules governing the procedure, though generally if someone
strongly objects the access is not offered, or is offered on a
provisional basis.

The criteria for commit access are that the person's patches adhere to
the guidelines in this file, adhere to all the usual unquantifiable
rules of coding (code should readable, robust, maintainable, etc), and
that the person respects the "Hippocratic Principle": first, do no
harm.  In other words, what is significant is not the size or quantity
of patches submitted, but the degree of care shown in avoiding bugs
and minimizing unnecessary impact on the rest of the code.  Many
committers are people who have not made major code contributions, but
rather lots of small, clean fixes, each of which was an unambiguous
improvement to the code.

See the COMMITTERS file for a complete list of committers.



The Configuration/Build System Under Unix
=========================================

Greg Stein wrote a custom build system for Subversion, which had been
using `automake' and recursive Makefiles.  Now it uses a single,
top-level Makefile, generated from Makefile.in (which is kept under
revision control).  `Makefile.in' in turn includes `build-outputs.mk',
which is automatically generated from `build.conf' by the
`gen-make.py' script.  Thus, the latter two are under revision
control, but `build-outputs.mk' is not.

Here is Greg's original mail describing the system, followed by some
advice about hacking it:

   Okay... this is it. We're now on the build system.

       "It works on my machine."

   I suspect there may be some tweaks to make on differents OSs. I'd be
   interested to hear if Ben can really build with normal BSD make. It
   should be possible.

   The code supports building, installation, checking, and
   dependencies. It does *NOT* yet deal with the doc/ subdirectory. That
   is next; I figured this could be rolled out and get the kinks worked
   out while I do the doc/ stuff.  Oh, it doesn't build Neon or APR yet
   either. I also saw a problem where libsvn_fs wasn't getting built
   before linking one of the test proggies (see below).

   Basic operation: same as before.

   $ ./autogen.sh
   $ ./configure OPTIONS
   $ make
   $ make check
   $ make install

   There are some "make check" scripts that need to be fixed up. That'll
   happen RSN. Some of them create their own log, rather than spewing to
   stdout (where the top-level make will place the output into
   [TOP]/tests.log).

   The old Makefile.am files are still around, but I'll be tossing those
   along with a bunch of tweaks to all the .cvsignore files. There are a
   few other cleanups, too. But that can happen as a step two.

   [ $ cvs rm -f `find . -name Makefile.rm`

     See the mistake in that line? I didn't when I typed it. The find
     returned nothing, so cvs rm -f proceeded to delete my entire
     tree. And the -f made sure to delete all my source files, too. Good
     fugging thing that I had my mods in some Emacs buffers, or I'd be
     bitching.

     I am *so* glad that Ben coded SVN to *not* delete locally modified
     files *and* that we have an "undel" command. I had to go and tweak a
     bazillion Entries files to undo the delete...
   ]

   The top-level make has a number of shortcuts in it (well, actually in
   build-outputs.mk):

   $ make subversion/libsvn_fs/libsvn_fs.la

   or

   $ make libsvn_fs

   The two are the same. So... when your test proggie fails to link
   because libsvn_fs isn't around, just run "make libsvn_fs" to build it
   immediately, then go back to the regular "make".

   Note that the system still conditionally builds the FS stuff based
   on whether DB (See 'Building on Unix' below) is available, and
   mod_dav_svn if Apache is available.

   Handy hint: if you don't like dependencies, then you can do:

   $ ./autogen.sh -s

   That will skip the dependency generation that goes into
   build-outputs.mk. It makes the script run quite a bit faster (48 secs
   vs 2 secs on my poor little Pentium 120).

   Note that if you change build.conf, you can simply run:

   $ ./gen-make.py build.conf

   to regen build-outputs.mk. You don't have to go back through the whole
   autogen.sh / configure process.

   You should also note that autogen.sh and configure run much faster now
   that we don't have the automake crap. Oh, and our makefiles never
   re-run configure on you out of the blue (gawd, I hated when automake
   did that to me).

   Obviously, there are going to be some tweaky things going on. I also
   think that the "shadow" builds or whatever they're called (different
   source and build dirs) are totally broken. Something tweaky will have
   to happen there.  But, thankfully, we only have one Makefile to deal
   with.

   Note that I arrange things so that we have one generated file
   (build-outputs.mk), and one autoconf-generated file (Makefile from
   .in).  I also tried to shove as much logic/rules into
   Makefile.in. Keeping build-outputs.mk devoid of rules (thus, implying
   gen-make.py devoid of rules in its output generation) manes that
   tweaking rules in Makefile.in is much more approachable to people.

   I think that is about it. Send problems to the dev@ list and/or feel
   free to dig in and fix them yourself. My next steps are mostly
   cleanup. After that, I'm going to toss out our use of libtool and rely
   on APR's libtool setup (no need for us to replicate what APR already
   did).

   Cheers,
   -g

And here is some advice for those changing or testing the
configuration/build system:

   From: Karl Fogel <kfogel@collab.net>
   To: dev@subversion.tigris.org
   Subject: when changing build/config stuff, always do this first
   Date: Wed 28 Nov 2001

   Yo everyone: if you change part of the configuration/build system,
   please make sure to clean out any old installed Subversion libs
   *before* you try building with your changes.  If you don't do this,
   your changes may appear to work fine, when in fact they would fail if
   run on a truly pristine system.

   This script demonstrates what I mean by "clean out".  This is
   `/usr/local/cleanup.sh' on my system.  It cleans out the Subversion
   libs (and the installed httpd-2.0 libs, since I'm often reinstalling
   that too):

      #!/bin/sh

      # Take care of libs
      cd /usr/local/lib
      rm -f APRVARS
      rm -f libapr*
      rm -f libexpat*
      rm -f libneon*
      rm -f libsvn*

      # Take care of headers
      cd /usr/local/include
      rm -f apr*
      rm -f svn*
      rm -f neon/*

      # Take care of headers
      cd /usr/local/apache2/lib
      rm -f *

   When someone reports a configuration bug and you're trying to
   reproduce it, run this first. :-)

How to create a distribution tarball
====================================

Pretty simple -- do this under Unix:

   1. Get a completely up-to-date working copy with no local mods.
      Make sure that APR is also up-to-date and pristine.  Build
      Subversion and run the test suite, just to be safe.

   2. Run "make dist".  This invokes `dist.sh', which checks out
      Subversion and APR from their master repositories, then runs the
      pre-configuration steps, so that the user will be able to run
      `configure' right after unpacking.  Watch dist.sh's output to
      make sure everything goes smoothly.

   3. When it's done, you'll have `subversion-rBLAH.tar.gz' in the top
      level of your working copy (BLAH is a revision number).  That's
      your distribution.  Unpack it on a clean machine, make sure it
      works, and upload it to

         http://subversion.tigris.org/servlets/ProjectDownloadList

      If you're making a new distribution in a hurry because the
      previous one is known to have problems, it's fine to upload
      first and then test, because the chances of the dist behaving
      differently from your working copy are very small -- it should
      be exactly the same code.

These guidelines may get stricter when we have a real user base; for
now, a distribution is just a bootstrap mechanism to obtain a working
copy.



Release numbering
=================

Please see http://apr.apache.org/versioning.html -- Subversion uses
the same guidelines.
