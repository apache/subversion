NOTES on a revamped editor interface

-- all paths are relpaths
   -- could be: relative to wcroot, or repos, or <what else?>
   -- editor/driver can map into other path spaces as appropriate

Terminology:
  "Driver" -- the code *calling* these APIs to tell the Receiver how
    to edit a tree into a final state

  "Receiver" -- the code *implementing* the callbacks to receive
    information on editing its tree


API will be like svn_stream_t, RA, and FS
  -- functional API to invoke callbacks
  -- can remap between versions
  -- implementor can provide vtable-ish thing for quick-load
     -- svn_editor_setcb_many(...)
  -- API can debug the control flow
     -- enforcement of constraints
     -- printf() for debugging
  -- single baton passed to all callbacks
     -- no directory or file batons
     -- only cross-call state that needs to be held is to manage the
        two-call change operations. state may need to be held for
        directory children that have not been added via add_*().
  -- no return values, so scratch_pool everywhere
  -- get_info takes a result_pool/scratch_pool
  -- treedit object passed to all calls: used for get_info callback
  -- separate baton for get_info callback
  -- build cancellation in by default
     -- notify is too operation specific, so it gets omitted


add_directory(path, children, props, replaces_rev)
  -- name all children. receiver can put on "pending" list
  -- MUST be followed (at some point) by add_*() calls for each child
  -- if replaces_rev isn't SVN_INVALID_REVNUM, this is an atomic replace.
     Use a revnum because it implies all other info like node kind etc.
add_directory_streamy(path, children_stream, props, replaces_rev)
  -- receiver reads (streamily) the names of all children
  -- MUST be followed (at some point) by add_*() calls for each child
  -- this alternative is to avoid cases where a directory might have
     100k child names held in memory at once
     -- not entirely sure about this, since we *already* hold all
        metadata for a single commit in memory. but maybe this will be
        able to help us moving forward to reach a more streamy commit
  -- if replaces_rev isn't SVN_INVALID_REVNUM, this is an atomic replace.
add_file(path, props, replaces_rev)
  -- MUST be followed (at some point) by set_text()
  -- if replaces_rev isn't SVN_INVALID_REVNUM, this is an atomic replace.
add_symlink(path, target, props, replaces_rev)
add_absent(path, kind, replaces_rev)
set_props(path, against_rev, props, complete)
  -- 'complete' indicates whether this completes the change to this node
     -- MUST be TRUE for directories
     -- if TRUE, then a set_text() MUST follow if node is a file
     -- if TRUE, then a set_target() MUST follow if node is a symlink
set_text(path, against_rev, checksum, stream)
  -- completes the change for this file (ie. if set_props was called)
  -- stream can be ignored by recipient if it knows the checksum
     -- for example: optimize away multiple transfers of the same file
  -- include a mime type to help recipient manage stream processing?
set_target(path, against_rev, target)
  -- completes the change for this symlink (ie. if set_props was called)
delete(path, in_rev)
copy(src_path, src_rev, dst_path)
move(src_path, in_src_rev, dst_path)
complete()
  -- all done. edit runs are not intended to be transactional, but
     this *could* be used for that.
abort()
  -- edit runs are not fully transactional. this is not guaranteed to
     undo everything.



-- expectations around *what* is being changed
   -- add into parent REV. nah. you're adding to HEAD. only Q: already exists.
   -- set props/text/target on REV. oops. there is newer.
   -- delete REV. woah. edited, or deleted already.
   -- copy: nah. just like add. (rev specifics source, not an expectation)
   -- move REV: source will be like a delete, so could have been edited/deleted


note: all calls complete their change to the node before they return,
except for the following pairs of functions:
  -- add_file / set_text
  -- set_props / set_text
  -- set_props / set_target


callback for more details about the BASE:
get_info(path, *kind, *revision, *checksum, *children, *target,
               *props, *stream)
  -- I think we might want to eliminate this, and make it specific to
     the RA layer. I'm not sure that any other caller needs
     information about the BASE in order to construct a delta.
  -- well, maybe mod_dav_svn in order to get BASE info to construct
     differential data for transmit-over-wire
  -- in v1, we had the BASE checksum as we attempted to modify a file.
     this api says "working against REV, here are the new contents".
     we can verify REV, but how to verify the checksum? thus, the
     callback to get more information about BASE.


other constraints:
-- one or both of add_directory() and add_directory_streamy() MUST be
   implemented. the editor layer can remap between drivers and receivers
-- parent add_directory() MUST be called prior to add_* of any child
-- set_props() MUST be called before set_text() and set_target() if a
   two-part change is occurring
-- add_*() called where a node already exists; must pass a REPLACES_REV
   parameter to add_*(), or delete() or move() before calling add_*().
   Passing REPLACES_REV is preferable to a separate delete(). Having a
   separate delete() (a non-atomic replace) should be considered carefully
   and, if chosen, should be well contained in a small amount of code.
-- set_*(), delete(), copy(), move() called on a non-existent node
-- call flow errors if:
   -- at complete() call time:
      -- add_* not called for a child listed in add_directory's CHILDREN
      -- set_text() not called after an add_file()
      -- set_text() not called after a set_props() on a file where
         COMPLETE=FALSE
      -- set_target() not called after a set_props() on a symlink where
         COMPLETE=FALSE
   -- anything called after complete() or abort()


Q: why specify the entire list of children at add_directory() time?
A: makes add_directory() an "atomic" operation. if it returns, then
   the directory is added (no multi-step change). you will have a
   bunch of incomplete *children* but the directory will be
   fine. makes it easier to resume.
   
   the alternative is a directory that stays "incomplete" until all
   children have been added. and that isn't known without some kind of
   "close_directory" call, or possibly a counter passed to the add. in
   either case, midway failure leaves you in a state where you don't
   know which children need to be resent. gotta grab them all again.


new interface: svn_editor.h
  -- don't try to rev svn_delta_editor_t. creates a huge mess
  -- svn_editor_* prefix
  -- svn_editor_setcb_* to set the various callbacks
     -- svn_editor_setcb_many(vtable) to copy funcs in

  -- provide an svn_delta_editor_t that can drive an svn_editor_t
     -- driver will need to "peek" around the shim in order to pass
        the list of all children to add_directory(). otherwise, we'd
        have to buffer *everything*. not to mention that children
        aren't really described unless a change is happening, so this
        shim needs special access to get the list anyways
  -- provide an svn_editor_t that can drive an svn_delta_editor_t
  -- note that using the above two shims, we "should" actually be able
     insert a matched pair "anywhere" between existing drivers/editors
     and have the code continue to function properly
