0. Goals
========

   Many users have very large trees of which they only want to
   checkout certain parts.  In Subversion <= 1.4, 'checkout -N' is not
   up to this task.

   Subversion 1.5 introduces the idea of "depth" (controlled via the
   '--depth' and '--set-depth' options) as a replacement for mere
   non-recursiveness (formerly controlled via the '-N' option).  Depth
   allows working copies to have exactly the contents the user wants,
   leaving out everything else.

1. Design
=========

   We have a new "depth" field in .svn/entries, which has (currently)
   four possible values: depth-empty, depth-files, depth-immediates,
   and depth-infinity.  Only this_dir entries may have depths other
   than depth-infinity.
   
      depth-empty ------>  Updates will not pull in any files or
                           subdirectories not already present.
   
      depth-files ------>  Updates will pull in any files not already
                           present, but not subdirectories.
   
      depth-immediates ->  Updates will pull in any files or
                           subdirectories not already present; those
                           subdirectories' this_dir entries will
                           have depth-empty.
   
      depth-infinity --->  Updates will pull in any files or
                           subdirectories not already present; those
                           subdirectories' this_dir entries will
                           have depth-infinity.  Equivalent to
                           today's default update behavior.
   
   The new '--depth' option limits how far an operation descends, and
   the new '--set-depth' option changes the depth of a working copy tree.

   The new options are explained in more detail in 'Usage' below, but
   these two concepts will aid understanding:

      "ambient depth" -----> The depth, or combination of depths,
                             of a given working copy.

      "requested depth" ---> The depth the user requested for a
                             particular operation (e.g., checkout,
                             update, switch).  This is sometimes
                             called the "operational depth".

   When when running an operation in a working copy, the requested
   depth never goes deeper than the ambient depth.  For example, if
   you run 'svn status --depth=infinity' in a working copy directory
   that was checked out with '--depth=immediates', the status will go
   as far as depth immediates.  That is, it descends all the way
   ("infinity") into what's available, but in this case what's
   available is shallower than infinity.

2. User interface
=================
   
   Quick start:

   Run checkout with --depth=empty or --depth=files.  When you need
   additional files or directories, pull them in with 'svn up NAME'
   (passing --depth for directories as appropriate).
   
   Not-so-quick start:

   checkout without --depth or -N behaves the same as it does today,
   which is the same as with --depth=infinity.

   checkout --depth=(empty|files|immediates) creates a working copy
   that is (empty | has only files | has files and empty subdirs).

   Inside such a working copy, running 'svn up' by itself will update
   only what is already present, but running 'svn up OMITTED_SUBDIR'
   will cause OMITTED_SUBDIR to be brought in at depth-infinity, while
   the rest of the parent working copy remains at its previous depth.

   The --depth option limits how far an operation recurses.  The
   operation will reach whatever is inside the intersection of the
   ambient depth and the requested depth (see 'Design' section for
   definitions).

   The --depth option never changes the depth of an existing dir.
   Instead, use the new '--set-depth=NEW_DEPTH' option for that.
   Right now, --set-depth can only extend (that is, make deeper) a
   directory.  (In the future, it will also be able to contract; see
   issue #2843.)  We disallow '--depth' and '--set-depth' together.

   The -N option has been deprecated, but still works: it simply maps
   to one of --depth=files, --depth=empty, or --depth=immediates,
   depending on context, for compatibility.  For most commands, it's
   --depth=files, but for status it's --depth=immediates, and for
   revert and add it's --depth=empty, to be compatible with the
   varying behaviors -N had across these commands.

   'svn info' lists depth, iff invoked on a directory whose depth is
   not the default (depth infinity).
   
3. Examples
===========
   
   svn co http://.../A
   
       Same as today; everything has depth-infinity.
   
   svn co -N http://.../A
   
       Today, this creates wc containing only mu.  Now, this will be
       identical to 'svn co --depth=files /A'.
   
   svn co --depth=empty http://.../A Awc
   
       Creates wc Awc, but empty: no files, no subdirectories.
   
       Awc/.svn/entries                this_dir    depth-empty
   
   svn co --depth=files http://.../A Awc1
   
       Creates wc Awc1 with all files (i.e., Awc1/mu) but no
       subdirectories.
   
       Awc1/.svn/entries               this_dir    depth-files
       ...
   
   svn co --depth=immediates http://.../A Awc2
   
       Creates wc Awc2 with all files and all subdirectories, but
       subdirectories are empty.
   
       Awc2/.svn/entries               this_dir    depth-immediates
                                       B
                                       C
       Awc2/B/.svn/entries             this_dir    depth-empty
       Awc2/C/.svn/entries             this_dir    depth-empty
       ...
   
   svn up Awc/B:
   
       Since B is not yet checked out, add it at depth infinity.
   
       Awc/.svn/entries                this_dir    depth-empty
                                       B
       Awc/B/.svn/entries              this_dir    depth-infinity
                                       ...
       Awc/B/E/.svn/entries            this_dir    depth-infinity
                                       ...
       ...
   
   svn up Awc
   
       Since A is already checked out, don't change its depth, just
       update it.  B and everything under it is at depth-infinity,
       so it will be updated just as today.
   
   svn up --depth=immediates Awc/D
   
       Since D is not yet checked out, add it at depth-immediates.
   
       Awc/.svn/entries                this_dir    depth-empty
                                       B
                                       D
       Awc/D/.svn/entries              this_dir    depth-immediates
                                       ...
       Awc/D/G/.svn/entries            this_dir    depth-empty
       ...
   
   svn up --depth=infinity Awc
   
       Update Awc at depth-empty, and Awc/B at depth-infinity, since
       those are the ambient depths of those two directories already.
   
       Awc/.svn/entries                this_dir    depth-empty
                                       ...
       Awc/B/.svn/entries              this_dir    depth-infinity
                                       ...
   
   svn up --set-depth=infinity Awc/D
   
       Pull everything into Awc/D, resulting in a subdirectory that is
       just as if it had been pulled in with no --depth flag at all.
   
       Awc/.svn/entries                this_dir    depth-empty
                                       B
                                       D
       Awc/D/.svn/entries              this_dir    depth-infinity
                                       ...
       ...

4. Implementation Strategy
==========================
   
   It would be nice if all this could be accomplished with just simple
   tweaks to how we drive the update reporter (svn_ra_reporter2_t).
   However, it's not that easy.
   
   Handling 'checkout --depth=empty' would be easy.  It should get us
   an empty directory at depth-empty, with no files and no subdirs,
   and if we just report it as at HEAD every time, the server will
   never send updates down (hmmm, this could be a problem for getting
   dir property updates, though).  Then any files or subdirs we have
   explicitly included we can just report at their respective
   revisions, and get proper updates; at least that'll work for the
   depth infinity ones.
   
   But consider 'checkout --depth=immediates'.  The desired state is a
   depth-immediates directory D, with all files up-to-date, and with
   skeleton subdirs at depth empty.  Plain updates should preserve this
   state of affairs.
   
   If we report D as at its BASE revision, files at their BASE
   revisions, and subdirs at HEAD, then:
   
      - When new files appear in the repos, they'll get sent down (good)
      - When new subdirs appear, they'll get sent down in full (bad)
   
   But if we don't report subdirs as at HEAD, then the server will try to
   update them (bad).  And if we report D at HEAD, then the working copy
   won't receive new files that have appeared in the repository since D's
   BASE revision (note that we *can* get updates for files we already
   have, though, by continuing to report them at their respective BASEs).
   
   The same logic applies to subdirectories at depth-files or
   depth-immediates.
   
   So, for efficient depth handling, the client directly reports the
   desired depth to the server; i.e., we extend the RA protocol.
   
   Meanwhile, legacy servers will send back a bunch of information the
   client doesn't want, and the client just ignores it, and the user
   never knows except for the fact that everything seems slow (but
   once their servers are upgraded, it'll speed up).

5. Compatibility Matters
========================

   This feature introduces two new concepts into the RA protocol which
   will not be understood by older servers:

      * Reported Depths -- the depths associated with individual paths
        included by the client in the description (via the
        svn_ra_reporter_t) of its working copy state.  

      * Requested Depth -- the single depth value used to limit the
        scope of the server's response to the client.
        
   As such, it's useful to understand how these concepts will be
   handled across the compatibility matrix of depth-aware and
   non-depth-aware clients and servers.

   NOTE: in the sections below, it is not necessarily that case that a
   value or state which is said to be "transmitted" literally has a
   presence in the RA protocol.  Some such bits of state have default
   values in the protocol and can therefore be effectively transmitted
   while not literally identifiable in a network trace of the
   client-server traffic.

   Depth-aware Clients (DACs)

      DACs will transmit reported depths (with "infinity" as the
      default) and will transmit a requested depth (with "unknown" as
      the default).  They will also -- for the sake of older,
      non-depth-aware servers (NDASs) -- transmit a requested recurse
      value derived from the requested depth:
   
         depth        recurse
         -----        -------
         empty        no
         files        no
         unknown      yes
         immediates   yes
         infinity     yes

      When speaking to an NDAS, the requested recurse value is the
      only thing the server understands , but is obviously more
      "grainy" than the requested depth concept.  The DAC, therefore,
      must filter out any additional, unwanted data that the server
      transmits in its response.  (This filtering will happen in the
      RA implementation itself so the RA APIs behave as expected
      regardless of the server's pedigree.)

      When speaking to a depth-aware server (DAS), the requested
      recurse value is ignored.  A requested depth of "unknown" means
      "only send information about the stuff in my report,
      depth-aware-ily".  Other requested depth values are honored by
      the server properly, and the DAC must handle the transformation
      of any working copy depths from their pre-update to their
      post-update depths and content as described in `3. Examples'.

   Non-depth-aware Clients (NDACs)

      NDACs will never transmit reported depths and never transmit a
      requested depth.  But they will transmit a requested recurse
      value (either "yes" or "no", with "yes" being the default).  (A
      DAS uses the presence of a requested depth in the actual protocol
      to distinguish DACs from NDACs, and knows to ignore the
      requested recurse value transmitted by a DAC.)

      When speaking to an NDAS, what happens happens.  It's the past,
      man -- you don't get to define the interaction this late in the
      game!

      When speaking to a DAS, the not-reported depths are treated like
      reported depths of "infinity", and the reported recurse values
      "yes" and "no" map to depths of "infinity" and "files",
      respectively.

6. API Changes
==============

   A new enum type 'svn_depth_t depth' is defined in svn_types.h.
   Both client and server side now understand the concept of depth,
   and the basic update use cases handle depth.  See depth_tests.py.

   On the client side, most of the svn_client.h interfaces that
   formerly took 'svn_boolean_t recurse' have been revved and their
   successors take 'svn_depth_t depth' instead.  Each old API now
   documents how it converts 'recurse' to 'depth'.

   Some of this recurse-becomes-depth change has propagated down into
   libsvn_wc, which now stores a depth field in svn_wc_entry_t (and
   therefore in .svn/entries).  The update reporter knows to report
   differing depths to the server, in the same way it already reports
   differing revisions.  In other words, take the concept of "mixed
   revision" working copies and extend it to "mixed depth" working
   copies.

   On the server side, most of the significant changes are in
   libsvn_repos/reporter.c.  The code that receives update reports now
   receives notice of paths that have different depths from their
   parent, and of course the overall update operation has a global
   depth, which applies except when restricted by some shallower local
   depth for a given path.

   The RA code on both sides knows how to send and receive depths; the
   relevant svn_ra_* APIs now take depth arguments, which sometimes
   supersede older 'recurse' booleans.  In these cases, the RA layer
   does the usual compatibility dance: receiving "recurse=FALSE" from
   an older client causes the server to behave as if "depth=files"
   had been transmitted.
