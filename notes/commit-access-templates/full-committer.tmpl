Subject: Full commit access to Subversion

Hi New Full Committer,

The other committers and I would like to offer you full commit access
to Subversion.

If you already have partial commit access, you can accept this offer
by simply replying to this mail.  We'll update the COMMITTERS file (or
you can do it yourself, that's fine too).

If you do not already have partial commit access, you can accept this
offer by replying to this mail and following the instructions at
<http://www.apache.org/dev/new-committers-guide.html#cla>.  A temporary
password will be chosen for you and revealed via email.  Once you are
notified that your account has been created, you are encouraged to
modify the COMMITTERS file appropriately, which also serves as a test
of your new username and password.

Please remember to subscribe to the private (PMC) mailing list by
emailing <private-subscribe{AT}subversion.apache.org>, and to checkout
a working copy of https://svn.apache.org/repos/private/pmc/subversion/.

Remember that you can still post patches for review before committing,
when you want to.  Commit access just means that you can rely on your
own judgment to decide when something is ready for commit.  Also, if
you haven't done so already, please read

   http://subversion.apache.org/docs/community-guide/

Thanks for all your work so far!

- Some Full Committer
