You'll probably need customize this heavily for the particular person

Subject: Commit access for Subversion FROBLINGS area

Hi New Partial Committer,

The other committers and I would like to offer you partial commit
access for maintenance of the Subversion FROBLINGS area.  To accept
this offer, please send your tigris.org username and a (plaintext or
htpasswd-crypted) password to svnadmin{AT}svn.collab.net.  Or if you
already have commit access to another area, you can just update
COMMITERS appropriately.

Remember that you can still post patches for review before committing,
when you want to.  Commit access just means that you can rely on your
own judgement to decide when something is ready for commit.  Also, if
you haven't done so already, please read

   http://subversion.tigris.org/hacking.html

Thanks for all your work so far!

- Some Full Committer
