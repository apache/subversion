This file exists to attempt to track the resources and ideas that are
present in the Subversion community on the topic of GUIs for Subversion.

The following is a list of folks that are currently believed to have
interest in helping to implement a Subversion GUI.  If you'd like to
be added (or removed) from this list, and you have CVS access to the
Subversion project, feel free to make the edit.  If you don't have CVS
access, just pop a mail off to dev@subversion.tigris.org and request
the change be made.
