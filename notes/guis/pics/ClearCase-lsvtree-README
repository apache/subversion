These four screenshots show ClearCase's version tree GUI in
action. The version tree shows the versions of a repository element,
along with annotations such as merge arrows, labels, and branch names.

    This is a simple view of a relatively new file. Looking at the
    merge arrows, you can see it was created on the dev_ng branch,
    then merged onto dev_lj and dev_anno_lj. The "0" versions are only
    placeholders on empty branches.

    The annotations describe the different elements of the interface
    and some of the toolbar controls. All of those are also accesible
    from the keyboard, context menu and toolbar menu.


ClearCase-lsvtree-2.gif:

    Same file, but showing only versions contributing to the version
    in the current view (working copy in SVN terms). Notice the
    tooltip on the selected version. It can also show the version's
    change log, which just happens to be empty in this case.

    (Interesting note: ClearCase can be configured to ask for a change
    log at check-out time, not just check-in. This is extremely useful
    because it acts as a reminder for the developer, and other people
    can see what you're doing.)


ClearCase-lsvtree-3.gif:

    Same as 1, but with "Show all versions" turned off. Only "interesting"
    versions, those that are either contributors, merge sources or
    merge targets are shown.


ClearCase-lsvtree-4.gif:

    This is a real-life example. this file has gone throuth four major
    revisions of a product, spanning 2.5 years of development on two
    locations. At first sight the tree looks confusiing, but it's very
    easy to navigate and operate on once you get used to it.
