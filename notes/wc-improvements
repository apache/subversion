Anyone who has worked on the libsvn_wc code will have discovered that
the current code is a complicated mess of special cases, and that it
is difficult to understand, inconsistent, slow and buggy.  I know this
because I wrote some of it.  It's possible that the libsvn_wc code
will gradually evolve into an elegant, efficient, code base; on the
other hand comments like "when we rewrite libsvn_wc" regularly appear
on the dev list.  This document is *not* a plan or design for a
rewrite, it's just some of the thoughts of a libsvn_wc hacker.

From Past to Present
====================

The original code for libsvn_wc used an implementation that stored
more or less all state information on disk in the .svn area on disk,
so during most operations the entries files were read and written many
times.  This led to the development of an API that passed around a lot
of path parameters (as svn_string_t* originally, as const char* now)
and to the development of the svn_io_xxx functions, which also accept
path parameters.  The implementation was slow, and didn't scale
particularly well as working copies got larger.  To improve things the
current access baton and entries caching system was gradually hacked
in, and libsvn_wc is now faster and scales a bit better, but problems
still remain.

My favourite example of the problems caused by the "path as parameter"
API is svn_wc_props_modified_p.  It's basic function is to determine
if the base props file and the working props file are the same or
different, but physical IO operations have to be repeated because they
are buried behind several layers of API.  It's difficult to fix
without rewriting, or duplicating, a number of svn_io_xxx and
svn_wc_xxx functions.  Aside from the repeated IO itself, each IO
operation also has to repeat the UTF-8 to native path conversion.

The current entries caching makes things faster than in the past, but
has it's own problems.  Most operations now cache the entire entries
hierarchy in memory which limits the size of the working copies that
can be handled.  The problem is difficult to solve as some operations
make multiple passes--commit for instance makes a first pass searching
for modifications, a second pass reporting to the repository, and a
third pass to do post-commit processing.

The original code also did not always make a distinction between the
versioned hierarchy in the entries file and the physical hierarchy on
disk.  Things like using stat() or svn_io_check_path() calls to
determine whether an item was versioned as file or directory do not
work when the working copy on disk is obstructed or incomplete.

The Future
==========

Some of these ideas are trivial, some of them are difficult to
implement, some of them may not work at all.

- Have an svn_wc_t context object, opaque outside the library, that
  would replace the access batons.  This would get passed through most
  of the libsvn_wc functions and could read/cache the entries files on
  demand as the working copy was traversed.  It could also cache the
  UTF-8 xlate handle.

- Have an API to svn_wc_entry_t, perhaps make the struct opaque, so
  that things like URL need not be constructed when the entries file
  is read but can be created on demand if required and possibly cached
  once created.  The aim would be to reduce the memory used by the
  entries cache.

- Consider caching physical IO results in svn_wc_entry_t/svn_wc_t.
  Should we really stat() any file more than once?  This becomes less
  important as we reduce the number of IO operations.

- Consider caching UTF-8 to native path conversions either in
  svn_wc_t, or svn_wc_entry_t, or locally in functions and using
  svn_io_xxx equivalents that accept native paths.  This becomes less
  important as we reduce the number of IO operations.

- Make interfaces pass svn_wc_entry_t* rather than simple paths.  The
  public API using const char* paths would remain to be used by
  libsvn_client et al.

- Maintain a clear distinction between the versioned hierarchy and the
  physical hierarchy when writing code, it's usually a mistake to use
  one when the other should be used.  To this end, audit the use of
  svn_io_check_path().

- Avoid using stat() to determine if an item is present on disk before
  using the item, just use it straight away and handle the error if it
  doesn't exist.

- Search out and destroy functions that read and discard entries files
  e.g. the apparently "simple" functions like svn_wc_is_wc_root or
  check_wc_root.  Such overhead is expensive when used by operations
  that are not going to do much other work, running status on a single
  file for example.  The overhead may not matter to a command line
  client, but it can matter to a GUI that makes many such calls.

- Get rid of .svn/README.txt and .svn/format.  Put the version
  information into .svn/entries instead, either in the xml or just as
  text on the first line.  Reading one file rather then two will put
  less load on the physical filesystem.  Consider supporting out of
  tree .svn directories.  Is the size of .svn/entries critical?  Would
  a custom, less verbose, format be better than XML?

- In the present code most operations are IO bound and have CPU to
  spare.  Perhaps compressed text-bases would make things faster
  rather than slower, by trading spare CPU for reduced IO?

- Keep track of the last text/prop time written into an entries file
  and store it in svn_wc_t.  Then when we come to do a timestamp sleep
  we can do it from the that time rather than the current time.

- Optimise property handling
  http://svn.haxx.se/dev/archive-2004-11/0318.shtml

  * When an item has no props dispense with the base and working
    property files.  When an item has no property modifications
    dispense with the working property file. These changes should make
    it possible for svn_wc_props_modified_p to use a single stat()
    when there are no property mods.

  * It might be possible to replace prop-time in the entries file
    with a props-modified flag and so have svn_wc_props_modified_p
    avoid all disk IO.

  * Consider caching svn:special in the entries file instead of (or as
    well as?) the properties file.  Status calls svn_wc__get_special
    for nearly every file, even unmodified ones, and that reads the
    properties file.  If the above property handling optimisations
    mean that svn_wc_props_modified_p usually avoids all disk IO then
    svn_wc__get_special could become a major bottleneck.

- The svn_wc_t context could work in conjunction with a more advanced
  svn_wc_crawl_revisions system.  This would provide a way of plugging
  multiple callbacks into a queue, probably with some sort of ordering
  and filtering ability, the aim being to replace most/all of the
  existing explicit loops.  This would put more of the pool handling in
  one central location, it may even be possible to provide different
  entry caching schemes.  I don't know how practical this idea is, or
  even if it is desirable.

- Have a .svn/deleted directory so that schedule delete directories
  can be moved out of the working copy. At present a skeleton hierarchy
  of schedule delete directories remains in the working copy until the
  delete is committed.

- When handling a delete received during update/switch perhaps do it
  in two stages.  First move the item into a holding area within .svn
  and finally delete all such items at the end of the update.  This
  would allow adds-with-history to use the deleted item and so might
  be a way to handle moves (implemented as delete plus add) in the
  presence of local modifications.  Thought would have to be given to
  the revision of the local deleted item, what happens if it doesn't
  match the copyfrom revision?  Perhaps we could get diffs, rather
  than full text, for adds-with-history if the copyfrom source is
  reported to the repository?

- Consider implementing atomic move for wc-to-wc moves, rather than
  using copy+delete.  This would be considerably faster for big
  directories, would lead to better revert behaviour, and avoid
  case-insensitivity problems (and if we ever get atomic mv in
  libsvn_fs then the wc code would be ready for it).

- Consider writing some libsvn_wc compiled C regression tests to allow
  more complete coverage.  Most of the current libsvn_wc testing is
  done via the command line client and it can be hard to get a working
  copy into the state necessary to test all code paths.

- There are some basic features that are fragile.  Switch has some
  bugs that can break a working copy, see issue 1906.  I don't know
  how the system is supposed to work in theory, let alone how it
  should be implemented.  Non-recursive checkout is broken, see issue
  695; this probably applies to non-recursive update and switch as well.

- Use absolute paths within libsvn_wc so that "." is not automatically
  a wc root.

- Read notes/entries-caching for some details of the logging/caching
  in the current libsvn_wc.  It's important that writing the entries
  file is handled efficiently.
