      <h4>Transactions of Obliteration</h4>


      <p>This section describes how the Obliterate Transaction works, using
        the model of obliteration in which an obliterated node-rev is
        deleted from its revision (and not replaced with other content). The
        functional spec diagrams for this model are in
        &lt;<a href="fspec-dd1/">notes/obliterate/fspec-dd1/</a>&gt;.</p>

      <div class="h5" id="server.fs.txn.simple">
        <h5>Simple Obliterate</h5>


        <p>Let us obliterate the file node-rev called "tuna" in r2, where the
          content said "Fried". We don't want anyone to see that content any
          longer.</p>

        <p>More precisely, let us obliterate the "tuna" entry in the directory
          known as "fish" in r2. If a copy of the file node whose content is
          "Fried", and that was called "tuna" in r2, also exists elsewhere (in
          a tag, a branch, a copy or another revision), let us choose to let
          all such copies remain in the repository for now. (We can obliterate
          them separately if we wish.) In this example, there are no such
          copies of the file node.</p>

        <p>We construct a transaction containing a new version of the r2
          tree. It is like the old r2 tree except we have a new node to hold
          the directory that no longer contains <tt
          class="filename">tuna</tt>, and a new node for each of its parent
          directories up to the root.</p>

        <p>We will do this in two steps. First, a begin_obliteration_txn()
          function will create a new transaction that is a mutable clone of
          the old r2. Second, we will use the normal transaction editing
          functions to delete the "tuna" entry.</p>

        <p>We link the new transaction in as r2, replacing the old r2. The old
          r2 tree does not yet go away; its nodes are still present and other
          revisions and transactions may be referring to them. This operation
          is analogous to the "finalize" stage of a commit, but it is not the
          final operation in an obliteration.</p>

        <p>Now the old r2 tree is orphaned. Some of its nodes are no longer
          referenced and can therefore be deleted. In particular, the old
          file-rev containing "Fried" is no longer referenced through r2 - and
          in our example it is not referenced from any other revision
          either.</p>

        <p>We could delete the orphaned nodes right away, or we could leave
          them in place for now and at some later time trawl through the list
          of all nodes looking for orphans and deleting them. The latter
          scheme is known as "garbage collection".</p>

        <p>Let us assume for now that we will delete the orphaned nodes right
          away. In fact, we will do it during the "finalization" so as not to
          leave any orphaned nodes in the tree. (The "no dead nodes" rule in
          &lt;<a href="../../www/design.html#server.fs.struct"
          >www/design.html#server.fs.struct</a>&gt;.)</p>

        <p>Starting from the root directory node of the old r2, we traverse
          that tree, deleting orphaned nodes from the top down. First we
          delete that root directory node. (This is just an illustration; the
          implementation can delete them in whatever order or manner it
          chooses, as long as it is transactional.)</p>

          known as "B" in place because it still has other parents, but delete
          that known as "A" because it becomes orphaned. Similarly we delete

        <p>That is the end of a simple obliteration, in which there were no
          other references in the repository to the obliterated node or its
          parents.</p>

        <p>Note that there is no restriction on references to other sub-trees
          of the original r2. For example, existing or future references to
          the node called "B" are unaffected, even if a transaction using such
          a reference is being constructed while this obliteration is
          happening.</p>

      <div class="h5" id="server.fs.txn.checks">
        <h5>Construction and Finalization Checks</h5>


        <p>Consider a case in which a normal commit transaction is being
          constructed at the same time as the above obliteration is carried
          out.  The new commit transaction includes a pointer to the node
          called "fish" in old r2, which exists at the time of construction.
          By the time we try to finalize this commit, the obliteration has
          been finalized and the node pointed to no longer exists. We cannot
          allow a transaction with a broken link to be committed.</p>

        <p>Finalization must include a check that all referenced existing
          nodes do in fact still exist. This check must be performed both in
          normal commit finalization and in obliterate finalization.</p>

        <p>That check could be costly if implemented naïvely, but there are
          ways to make it cheap. First, ensure no invalid node is added during
          construction. Second, detect whether any obliteration has been
          performed in the repository since the transaction was started.

        <h5>Obliterating a Node that is Referenced Elsewhere</h5>


        <p>We don't mean to obliterate the "node" but rather the
          directory entry that points to the node. If another directory entry
          in this same revision or in another revision points to the node, that
          is no problem: we will simply re-write the directory so as to remove
          the entry, but we will not delete the node itself because it will
          not be orphaned.</p>
