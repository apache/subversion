This file documents the 'svnpatch' format that's used with both diff and patch
subcommands.

I HISTORY
  -------

Subversion's diff facility by default generates an unidiff format output.  The
unidiff format is famous with tools like diff(1) and has been used for decades
to produce contextual differences between files.  We also often associate it
with patch(1) to apply those contextual differences.  When it comes to
non-contextual changes like moving a directory, adding a property to a file, or
modifying an image, unidiff is helpless.  Enters the svnpatch format.  It
enables capturing all non-contextual changes into a WC-portable output so that
it is possible to create rich patches to apply across working copies.  Another
way to look at it is as an "offline merge", in which one dumps the diffs,
passes them as a patch on to her peer who then applies it, without ever
interacting with the repository.

The svnpatch format is in fact a simplified version of the Subversion protocol
-- see subversion/libsvn_ra_svn/protocol -- that meets our needs.  The
advantage here is that changes are serialized into a language that Subversion
already speaks and only a few minor tweaks were needed to accommodate.  As an
example, revisions have been stripped from the protocol to allow fuzzing.

The implementation with the command line client uses `svn diff --svnpatch' to
generate the rich diffs and `svn patch' to apply the diffs against a working
copy.  Other frontends can also take advantage of svnpatch in the same way
through the usual API's svn_client_diff4 and svn_client_patch that use files to
communicate.


II SVNPATCH FORMAT IN A NUTSHELL
   -----------------------------

First off, let's define it.  svnpatch format is made of two ordered parts:
  * (a) human-readable: made of unidiff bytes
  * (b) computer-readable: made of svn protocol bytes (ra_svn), gzip'ed,
        base64-encoded

But, as we're not in a client/server configuration:
  - (b) only uses the svn protocol's Editor Command Set, there's no need for
    the Main Command Set nor the Report Command Set
  - a client reads Editor Commands from the patch, i.e. the patch silently
    drives the client's editor
  - the only direction the information takes is from the patch to the client
  - svndiff1 is solely used instead of being able to choose between svndiff1
    and svndiff0 (e.g. binary-change needs svndiff)

Such a format can be seen as a subset of the svn protocol which:
  - Capabilities and Edit Pipelining have nothing to do with as we can't adjust
    once the patch is rock-hard written in the file nor negotiate anything
  - commands are restricted to the Editor Command Set
  - lacks revision numbers and checksums except for binary files (see VI
    FUZZING)

For more about Command Sets, consult libsvn_ra_svn/protocol.


III BOUNDARIES BETWEEN THE TWO PARTS
    --------------------------------

Now since the svn protocol would be happy to handle just any change that a
working copy comes with, rules have to be set up so that we meet our goals (see
I HISTORY).

Concretely, what's in each part?

In (a):
 - contextual differences
 - property-changes (in a similar way to 'svn diff')
 - new non-binary-file content

In (b):
 - tree-changes ({add,del,move,copy}-directory, {add,del,move,copy}-file)
 - property-changes
 - binary-changes

Consequences are we face cases where one change's representation lives in the
two parts of the patch. e.g. a modified-file move: the move is represented
within (b) while contextual differences within (a);  a file add: an add-file
Editor Command in (b) plus its content in (a).

Furthermore, we never end up with redundant information but with
property-changes.  A file copy with modifications generates (a) contextual
diff, (b) add-file w/ copy-path.

The only thing that's left unreadable is tree-changes as defined above.
However, a higher level layer (e.g. GUIs) would perfectly be able to
base64-decode, uncompress and read operations to visually-render the changes.

The (b) block starts with a header and its version.

Here's what a directory add, a file add and a propset would look like:

[[[
Index: bar
===================================================================
--- bar
+++ bar
@@ -0,0 +1,2 @@
+This is bar content.
+

Property changes on: bar
___________________________________________________________________
Name: newprop
   + propval

======================== SVNPATCH BLOCK 1 =========================

/jajOzZHXqhZGp3i4Qe3df931IwwrBVePlyTX//3AAAA
]]]

Let's uncompress and decode the above base64 block (lines are wrapped):

( open-root ( ( ) 2:d0 ) ) ( add-file ( 3:bar 2:d0 2:c1 ( ) ) ) (
change-file-prop ( 2:c1 7:newprop ( 7:propval ) ) ) ( add-dir ( 3:foo 2:d0 2:d2
( ) ) ) ( close-dir ( 2:d2 ) ) ( close-dir ( 2:d0 ) ) ( close-file ( 2:c1 ( ) )
) ( close-edit ( ) )

Further examples can be found in subversion/tests/cmdline/diff_tests.py
test-suite.


IV SVNPATCH EDIT-ABILITY
   ---------------------

Because encoded and compressed, the computer-readable chunk (b) is not directly
editable.  Should it be in cleartext, the user would still have to go through
svn protocol writing manually -- calculate checksums and strings length, and
place tokens, assumed to be not so friendly for the end-user.  However, there's
a much easier workaround: apply the patch, and then start editing the working
copy with regular svn subcommands.  There's also the `--dry-run' option that
can help see what the patch will do.


V PATCHING
  --------

When it comes to applying an svnpatch patch (RAS syndrom), the 'svn patch'
subcommand is a good friend.  We don't currently support applying (a) Unidiffs
internally.  We instead call an external program to do the job for us which the
user may specify with the 'patch-cmd' entry in the run-time configuration.  'svn
patch' also has a --patch-cmd flag that overrides this run-time config.  When
none of those flags are specified, the ultimate fallback is to try to call
'patch'.  Since GNU patch is widely available on many UNIX-like platforms, this
workaround should cover a fairly large amount of users.  No decision nor
consensus have been taken towards this issue yet.
On the other hand, (b) is handled with internal routines that read and drive
editor functions out from the patch file much like what's being performed by
libsvn_ra_svn with a network stream.

Put differently, for now 'svn patch' will gladly apply any (full-featured-)patch
on GNU-patch-enabled environments while it will bail out with a message on a
GNU-patch-less one.  In the latter, the user is left the burden to apply the
Unidiff with his own tools.

Now some words about the order to process (a) and (b).  There might be cases
when operations to a single file live in the two parts of the patch (see above).
Since Unidiff indexes are made against the most up-to-date file name, it makes
sense that 'svn patch' first deals with the svnpatch block and then the Unidiff
block.  E.g. consider a WC with a file copy from foo to bar and then contextual
modifications to bar.  The patch that represents this WC changes would show
diffs against 'bar' file.  So 'svn patch' first has to schedule-add-with-history
bar from foo and then apply contextual diffs, which would not work the other way
around.

When the Editor Command Set comes to be extended, 'svn patch' will face
unexpected commands and/or syntax.  As in libsvn_ra_svn, we warn the user with
'unsupported command' messages and ignore its application.


VI FUZZING a.k.a. DYSTOPIA
   -----------------------

The svn protocol is not very sensitive to fuzzing since most operations include
a revision number.  However, to stick with this policy would widely lower the
patch-application scope we're expecting.  For instance, 'svn patch' would fail
at deleting dir@REV when REV is different from the one that comes with the
delete-entry Editor Command.  Obviously we need loose here, and the solution is
to free the svn protocol from revision numbers and checksums in our
implementation for every change but binary-changes (for the checksums).  (It
would be insane to associate binary stuff with fuzzing in this world.)  Now
dealing with (b) patching is similar in many ways to GNU Patch's: we end up
trying by all methods to drive the editor in the dark jungle, possibly failing
in few cases shooting 'hunk failed' warnings.


VII PATCH AND MERGE IN SUBVERSION
    -----------------------------

'svn patch' is similar in many ways to 'svn merge'.  Basically, we have a
tree-delta in hand that we want to apply to a working-tree.  Thus it's not
surprising to see they have a lot in common when comparing both implementations.
'patch' uses a mix of revamped merge_callbacks (see libsvn_client/merge.c) and
repos-repos editor functions (see libsvn_client/repos_diff.c).  Why not merge
those two together then, for code-share sake?  Well, although they share a close
logic, to join the two implies having one single file (repos_diff.c) to handle
at least three burdens:  repos-repos diff, merge, and patch.  Such a design
can't be achieved without a myriad of tests/conditions and a large amount of
blurry mess at mixing three different tools in one place.  In the end, what was
supposed to enhance software maintainability turned out to cause a lot of damage
at tightening different things together.
