/*** Commit Stuff ***/

/* The "Harvest Committables" System

   The commit process requires, per repository, a single drive of a
   commit editor which is based not on working copy paths, but on
   URLs.  The on-disk working copy hierarchy does not, in general,
   map to a similar in-repository hierarchy, due to switched subtrees
   and disjoint working copies.

   Also we wish to know exactly what would be committed, in advance of
   the commit, so that a log message editor can be initially populated
   with this information.

   The primary goal of this system is very straightforward: harvest
   all commit candidate information up front, and cache enough info in
   the process to use this to drive a URL-sorted commit.

   The idea is that commit-y processes ('svn mkdir URL', 'svn delete URL',
   'svn commit', 'svn copy WC_PATH URL', 'svn copy URL1 URL2', 'svn
   move URL1 URL2', others?) generate the cached commit candidate
   information, and hand this information off to a consumer which is
   responsible for driving the RA layer's commit editor in a
   URL-depth-first fashion and reporting back the post-commit
   information.

/*** Externals (Modules) ***/

/* Handle changes to the svn:externals property described by EXTERNALS_NEW,
   and AMBIENT_DEPTHS.  The tree's top level directory
   is at TARGET_ABSPATH which has a root URL of REPOS_ROOT_URL.
   A write lock should be held.

   For each changed value of the property, discover the nature of the
   change and behave appropriately -- either check a new "external"
   subdir, or call svn_wc_remove_from_revision_control() on an
   existing one, or both.

   TARGET_ABSPATH is the root of the driving operation and
   REQUESTED_DEPTH is the requested depth of the driving operation
   (e.g., update, switch, etc).  If it is neither svn_depth_infinity
   nor svn_depth_unknown, then changes to svn:externals will have no
   effect.  If REQUESTED_DEPTH is svn_depth_unknown, then the ambient
   depth of each working copy directory holding an svn:externals value
   will determine whether that value is interpreted there (the ambient
   depth must be svn_depth_infinity).  If REQUESTED_DEPTH is
   svn_depth_infinity, then it is presumed to be expanding any
   shallower ambient depth, so changes to svn:externals values will be
   interpreted.

   Pass NOTIFY_FUNC with NOTIFY_BATON along to svn_client_checkout().

   Set *TIMESTAMP_SLEEP to TRUE if a sleep is required; otherwise do not
   change *TIMESTAMP_SLEEP.  The output will be valid even if the function
   returns an error.

   If RA_SESSION is NOT NULL, it may be used to avoid creating a new
   session. The session may point to a different URL after returning.

   Use POOL for temporary allocation. */
