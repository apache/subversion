WORK IN PROGRESS
================

This directory contains an experimental implementation of SVN++, a
high-level Subversion C++ API.

It is far from complete and may never see the light of day.

On the other hand, one good reason for having a high-level C++ API is
to use it as a baseline for Swig-generated bindings. Our current set
of Perl, Python and Ruby bindings is too heterogenous in terms of
feature set, object and usage model. They're almost as hard to use as
the C API itself.


DESIGN GOALS
============

In no particular order:

  * Use modern C++ constructs (the current baseline is C++11).

  * Hide the dependency on APR that is exposed in Subversion's C API.

  * Use separate C++ types for different kinds of values returned
    from the C API (e.g., dirent vs. property value vs. URL), to make
    it easier to create generic typemaps for Swig.

  * Provide both synchronous and asynchronous interfaces.

  * Avoid unnecessary copies by defining strict lifetimes for
    returned values.

  * Provide API variants that accept wide strings as well as
    UTF-8-encoded narrow strings.

  * Provide high-level constructs for common parameter types; e.g.,
    revision ranges and lists for diff, merge, etc.

  * Provide optional header-only conversions and overload for Boost types (e.g.,
    boost::tribool, boost::filesystem::path), which can be enabled by users by
    defining the SVNXX_USE_BOOST symbol.

    These convenience overloads and conversions must *not* make the SVN++
    library depend on any Boost runtime libraries.

  * API versioning (how?).


API COVERAGE
============

Planned:

  * libsvn_client (highest priority)
  * svn_mtcc_*
  * utilities (diff, revision ranges/lists, etc.)
  * libsvn_ra
  * libsvn_repos/libsvn_fs (lowest priority)

Not planned:
  * libsvn_subr
  * libsvn_wc


C++ NAMESPACES AND SOURCE LAYOUT
================================

Public API
----------

The public API is in namespace apache::subversion::svnxx and we define
a namespace alias for that:

    namespace svn = ::apache::subversion::svnxx

All elements of the public API are defined or declared in header files
in the directory

    .../include/svnxx/*.hpp

with the single header file

    .../include/svnxx.hpp

importing all relevant headers from that directory.

Implementation details used by the public API and visible to user
code but that should not be directly used by user code are in the
namespace apache::subversion::svnxx::detail and should be defined
in header files in the directory:

    .../include/svnxx/detail/*.hpp

Note on API versioning
----------------------

Version-specific elements of the public API should be defined in
namespaces within the public namespace; e.g., for version 1.13:

    apache::subversion::svnxx::v_1_13

and the default (or selected) version will be exposed in the
parent namespace by inlining the namespace declaration.
This versioning does not apply to things declared in svn::detail.

Implementation
--------------

All entities that are private to the implementation should be
in the namespace apache::subversion::svnxx::impl and defined
in header files within the source directory tree:

    .../src/private/*_private.hpp

with the single header file

    .../src/private.hpp

importing all relevant headers from that directory. The exception to
this rule are C++ wrappers for APR types, which are defined in the
namespace apache::subversion::svnxx::apr in header files in the
directory:

    .../src/aprwrap/*.hpp

with the single header file

    .../src/aprwrap.hpp

importing all relevant headers from that directory.
