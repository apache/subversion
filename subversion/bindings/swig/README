     INSTALL file in this directory.


SVN HEADER -> SWIG MODULE
-------------------------

Subversion has a bunch of includes files, some are interesting for
wrapping with language bindings, and others which are simple type
declarations and constants. Below is the table which maps each header
to its disposition:

INCLUDE           SWIG MODULE NAME
svn_base64.h	  (1)
svn_client.h	  _client
svn_config.h	  ?
svn_delta.h	  _delta
svn_error.h	  (2)
svn_error_codes.h (2)
svn_fs.h	  _fs
svn_hash.h	  (1)
svn_io.h	  (4) (only stream functions)
svn_path.h	  (1)
svn_pools.h	  (4) (only pool manipulation)
svn_quoprint.h	  (1)
svn_ra.h	  _ra
svn_repos.h	  _repos
svn_sorts.h	  (1)
svn_string.h	  (3)
svn_test.h	  (2)
svn_time.h	  (1)
svn_types.h	  (3)
svn_version.h	  (4) (some symbols)
svn_wc.h	  _wc
svn_xml.h	  (1)

apr*.h		  (3)

n/a		  _util

(1) it is assumed that the binding languages will provide this
    functionality separately.
(2) no significant/interesting functionality to export
(3) only the types are exported; a SWIG interface file is present
(4) limited symbols/functionality exported via the _util module


NOTE: the bindings code is being developed using SWIG 1.3.16. Earlier
versions of SWIG will simply *not* work.




SWIG MODULES
------------

We will produce a number of modules, expecting the binding languages
to organize these into a package.

svn.client
svn.delta
svn.error
svn.fs
svn.io
svn.ra
svn.wc
