log: Show the log messages for a set of revision(s) and/or path(s).
usage: 1. log [PATH][@REV]
       2. log URL[@REV] [PATH...]

  1. Print the log messages for the URL corresponding to PATH
     (default: '.'). If specified, REV is the revision in which the
     URL is first looked up, and the default revision range is REV:1.
     If REV is not specified, the default revision range is BASE:1,
     since the URL might not exist in the HEAD revision.

  2. Print the log messages for the PATHs (default: '.') under URL.
     If specified, REV is the revision in which the URL is first
     looked up, and the default revision range is REV:1; otherwise,
     the URL is looked up in HEAD, and the default revision range is
     HEAD:1.

  Multiple '-c' or '-r' options may be specified (but not a
  combination of '-c' and '-r' options), and mixing of forward and
  reverse ranges is allowed.

  With -v, also print all affected paths with each log message.
  Each changed path is preceded with a symbol describing the change:
    A: The path was added or copied.
    D: The path was deleted.
    R: The path was replaced (deleted and re-added in the same revision).
    M: The path's file and/or property content was modified.
  If an added or replaced path was copied from somewhere else, the copy
  source path and revision are shown in parentheses.
  If a file or directory was moved from one path to another with 'svn move'
  the old path will be listed as deleted and the new path will be listed
  as copied from the old path at a prior revision.

  With -q, don't print the log message body itself (note that this is
  compatible with -v).

  Each log message is printed just once, even if more than one of the
  affected paths for that revision were explicitly requested.  Logs
  follow copy history by default.  Use --stop-on-copy to disable this
  behavior, which can be useful for determining branchpoints.

  The --depth option is only valid in combination with the --diff option
  and limits the scope of the displayed diff to the specified depth.

  If the --search option is used, log messages are displayed only if the
  provided search pattern matches any of the author, date, log message
  text (unless --quiet is used), or, if the --verbose option is also
  provided, a changed path.
  The search pattern may include "glob syntax" wildcards:
      ?      matches any single character
      *      matches a sequence of arbitrary characters
      [abc]  matches any of the characters listed inside the brackets
  If multiple --search options are provided, a log message is shown if
  it matches any of the provided search patterns. If the --search-and
  option is used, that option's argument is combined with the pattern
  from the previous --search or --search-and option, and a log message
  is shown only if it matches the combined search pattern.
  If --limit is used in combination with --search, --limit restricts the
  number of log messages searched, rather than restricting the output
  to a particular number of matching log messages.

  Examples:

    Show the latest 5 log messages for the current working copy
    directory and display paths changed in each commit:
      svn log -l 5 -v

    Show the log for bar.c as of revision 42:
      svn log bar.c@42

    Show log messages and diffs for each commit to foo.c:
      svn log --diff http://www.example.com/repo/project/foo.c
    (Because the above command uses a full URL it does not require
     a working copy.)

    Show log messages for the children foo.c and bar.c of the directory
    '/trunk' as it appeared in revision 50, using the ^/ URL shortcut:
      svn log ^/trunk@50 foo.c bar.c

    Show the log messages for any incoming changes to foo.c during the
    next 'svn update':
      svn log -r BASE:HEAD foo.c

    Show the log message for the revision in which /branches/foo
    was created:
      svn log --stop-on-copy --limit 1 -r0:HEAD ^/branches/foo

    If ^/trunk/foo.c was moved to ^/trunk/bar.c' in revision 22, 'svn log -v'
    shows a deletion and a copy in its changed paths list, such as:
       D /trunk/foo.c
       A /trunk/bar.c (from /trunk/foo.c:21)

switch (sw): Update the working copy to a different URL within the same repository.
usage: 1. switch URL[@PEGREV] [PATH]
       2. switch --relocate FROM-PREFIX TO-PREFIX [PATH...]

  1. Update the working copy to mirror a new URL within the repository.
     This behavior is similar to 'svn update', and is the way to
     move a working copy to a branch or tag within the same repository.
     If specified, PEGREV determines in which revision the target is first
     looked up.

     If --force is used, unversioned obstructing paths in the working
     copy do not automatically cause a failure if the switch attempts to
     add the same path.  If the obstructing path is the same type (file
     or directory) as the corresponding path in the repository it becomes
     versioned but its contents are left 'as-is' in the working copy.
     This means that an obstructing directory's unversioned children may
     also obstruct and become versioned.  For files, any content differences
     between the obstruction and the repository are treated like a local
     modification to the working copy.  All properties from the repository
     are applied to the obstructing path.

     Use the --set-depth option to set a new working copy depth on the
     targets of this operation.

     By default, Subversion will refuse to switch a working copy path to
     a new URL with which it shares no common version control ancestry.
     Use the '--ignore-ancestry' option to override this sanity check.

  2. The '--relocate' option is deprecated. This syntax is equivalent to
     'svn relocate FROM-PREFIX TO-PREFIX [PATH]'.

  See also 'svn help update' for a list of possible characters
  reporting the action taken.

  Examples:
    svn switch ^/branches/1.x-release
    svn switch --relocate http:// svn://
    svn switch --relocate http://www.example.com/repo/project \
                          svn://svn.example.com/repo/project
