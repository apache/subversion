     Oh Most High and Fragrant Emacs, please be in -*- text -*- mode!

This is the library described in the section "The working copy
management library" of svn-design.texi.

It performs local operations in the working copy, tweaking
administrative files and versioned data, generally in response to a
received delta.  It communicates with the server through libsvn_cl.

The Problem We're Solving.
==========================

The working copy is arranged as a directory tree, which, at checkout,
mirrors a tree rooted at some node in the repository.  Over time, the
working copy accumulates uncommitted changes, some of which may affect
its tree layout.  By commit time, the working copy's layout could be
arbitrarily different from the repository tree on which it was based.

Furthermore, updates/commits do not always involve the entire tree, so
it is possible for the working copy to go a very long time without
being a perfect mirror of some tree in the repository.

To resolve all situations safely, we define exactly what a "change" is
and what a "conflict" is, and how conflicts are resolved.

Kinds of Changes.
=================

As their trees change over time, the working copy and repository each
track changes to files and directories.  There are two kinds of
changes, "direct" and "indirect":

               Direct Change        Indirect Change
          ._____________________._____________________.
          | Change to file's    |                     |
   file   | contents; OR, file  |                     |
          | was added, removed, |  [No such thing]    |
          | or renamed          |                     |
          |_____________________|_____________________|
          |                     |  An immediate child |
   dir    | This dir was added, |  of this dir was    |
          | removed, or renamed |  added, removed, or |
          |                     |  renamed            |
          |_____________________|_____________________|

In other words, a change that directly affects an entity's textual
contents, its name, or its existence is a "direct" change.  A change
that affects the name or existence of an directory's immediate child
is an "indirect" change to the directory (although it's a direct
change to the child, of course).  Only directories can have indirect
changes.


Comparing Changes.
==================

In both commits and updates, the client and server must compare
changes in the working copy against changes in the repository.  For
commits, the comparison is part of the pre-commit up-to-date check;
for updates, the comparison determines what changes will be sent from
server to client.

Since commits do not change the working copy, pre-commit checks need
not do intelligent conflict checking and merging.  They are only
concerned with whether entities in question are "up-to-date" -- that
is, for the entities in question, have there been divergent changes
between working copy and repository?  If so, then the working copy is
out-of-date.

Updates, on the other hand, can affect the working copy.  Updates
merge changes into the working copy where possible (not only textual
changes, but even tree-structure changes), and describe conflicts as
usefully as possible when merging is not an option.

To understand how the above happens, you need to know

  * How the working copy describes its state to the server.

  * In the case of a commit,
       a) how the server uses this state to perform a pre-commit check.
       b) how the client completes the commit.

  * In the case of an update,
       a) how the server uses this state to generate an update delta.
       b) how the client applies an update delta.


How the working copy describes its state to the server.
=======================================================

The problem of describing the working copy's state to the server is
the same whether for pre-commit check or for update.  In both
scenarios, the working copy describes its state to the server by
sending over a "snapshot".  The server uses the snapshot to determine
how to respond to the client.  (The state includes only those entities
involved in the transaction -- the working copy is certainly not
required to describe its *entire* state for every operation.)

For the moment, let's treat the snapshot as a black box (in practice,
it's probably a skelta).  It contains one entry per entity, and each
entry consists of:

   Original Name      (a full path, of course)
   Original Version   (i.e., "base" version)
   Action             (content change, add, remove, rename...)
   New Name           (if any)
   New Version        (only if other than repository latest)

First of all, the snapshot must be consistent with itself -- if it
claims that two files have been renamed to the same name, or something
equally ridiculous, then the server simply rejects it out of hand.

Assuming the snapshot makes sense, the server

 (i.e., what gets merged vs what is
     flagged as a conflict, and especially what the verb "flag as a
     conflict" *means* in different kinds of conflicts).

WC State
R State
conflict

Def: Modifying a file's contents is a "direct change" to that file.

Def: A rename, add, or delete is considered a direct change to the
      target(s), and an "indirect change" to the parent(s).

Def: A working copy's "WC state" is a snapshot (maybe a skelta?) that
      shows the base versions, and any changes, for all entities in

Def: given a WC state, the repository could
      theoretically reconstruct the entire working copy, except for
      the actual content of uncomitted local changes.)
      [Define the black box way drawn on the board?]

Def: A "R state" is a list of all entities that have changed in the
      repository *relative* to a given WC state.  The repository can
      calculate the R state for a given a WC state.

Def: A WC state and a R state "conflict" iff they have any
      conflicting changes -- defined in (F) below.

Def: Changes conflict according to the following rules:

         - Two direct changes to the same entity always conflict.

         - An indirect and a direct change to the same entity conflict
           iff the direct change affects the entity's type (e.g., wc
           modifies foo/bar.c, but in the repository foo has been
           changed to a regular file).

         - Two indirect changes to the same entity never conflict.
           ??? or just if same name ???

         - Changes to different entities never conflict.

Def: The server never accepts a delta based on a WC state that
      conflicts with the repository.  The client is always responsible
      for sending non-conflicting deltas.

Given these principles [though see footnote 1], the process for
updates is largely the same as for commits, so the two are described
together here:

   1. The working copy creates a snapshot (W) of its state, and sends
      it to the server.

   2. The server checks if the entities listed in W have changed in
      the repository too [see footnote 2].  If there are no conflicts,
      then the commit is registered and a token sent back (or, if this
      is an update, the server sends back the appropriate delta).

   3. If there is a conflict, then...

         - commit case:
             Server sends back a message telling the working
             copy it must update.  By principle (G), the client can
             only commit based on a non-conflicting state, therefore
             the client must not only update, but also resolve any
             conflicts, before it can successfully commit.

         - update case:
             Well, this is where all the hardship happens. :-)

             First, a definition: "conflict-to-date" is when a working
             copy is up-to-date wherever there are no conflicts, but
             reflects both sides of the conflict wherever there *are*
             conflicts.

             The Subversion server tries, but is not required, to
             compute a delta that will bring the working copy
             conflict-to-date.  When it can do so, it sends this delta
             to the client, which then makes its working copy be
             conflict-to-date and leaves resolution to the user (same
             as CVS).

             However, for complex tree-structure conflicts, there is
             often no way to reflect both sides of the conflict in the
             working copy without being more confusing than helpful
             anyway.  How does one put "conflict markers" into a
             directory, especially when what was a directory might now
             be a file, or vice-versa?  For purely textual conflicts,
             CVS found a useful way to overlay the conflicting areas
             in all cases; if there is a similar overlay method for
             arbitrarily changed directory trees, I don't know what it
             is. :-)

             Therefore, an acceptable response from the Subversion
             server is: "Your working copy is too out of whack; please
             move it aside, check out a fresh one, redo your changes
             in the fresh copy, and commit from that."  (This response
             may apply to subtrees of the working copy, of course).

             The response will probably include more detail than that,
             of course.  In addition to the general out-of-whackness
             message, it can say "Directory foo was renamed to bar,
             conflicting with your new file bar; file blah was
             deleted, conflicting with your local change to file blah,
             ..." and so on.  The important thing is that these are
             informational only -- they're not changing the working
             copy, they're just telling the user what to examine when
             she syncs up two working trees manually.

             Subversion implements a _simple_ conflict-to-date delta
             generation algorithm initially.  It can improve as we get
             smarter and/or as there is demand for more informative
             conflicting updates.

--------------------------- Footnotes -----------------------------------

[1] Haven't thought carefully about whether this all works smoothly
when directory *entries* are considered entities.  I think so, but am
not sure yet.

[2] The working copy doesn't always want to compare against the pure
latest version in the repository -- it may be comparing against some
other version, or perhaps even different versions for different parts.
In fact, every entity in the working copy snapshot might have a
different "latest" to compare against, in addition to the possiblity
of a different base version.  I haven't thought about this carefully
yet either, but see no reason the snapshots can't include both sides
of the comparison for each entity.
