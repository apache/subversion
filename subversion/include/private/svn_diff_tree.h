/*
 *                   About the diff tree processor.
 *
 * Subversion uses two kinds of editors to describe changes. One to
 * describe changes on how to *exactly* transform one tree to another tree,
 * as efficiently as possible and one to describe the difference between trees
 * in order to review the changes, or to allow applying them on a third tree
 * which is similar to those other trees.
 *
 * The first case was originally handled by svn_delta_editor_t and might be
 * replaced by svn_editor_t in a future version. This diff processor handles
 * the other case and as such forms the layer below our diff and merge
 * handling.
 *
 * The major difference between this and the other editors is that this diff
 * always provides access to the full text and/or properties in the left and
 * right tree when applicable to allow processor implementers to decide how
 * to interpret changes.
 *
 * Originally this diff processor was not formalized explicitly, but
 * informally handled by the working copy diff callbacks. These callbacks just
 * provided the information to drive a unified diff and a textual merge. To go
 * one step further and allow full tree conflict detection we needed a better
 * defined diff handling. Instead of adding yet a few more functions and
 * arguments to the already overloaded diff callbacks the api was completely
 * redesigned with a few points in mind.
 *
 *   * It must be able to drive the old callbacks interface without users
 *     noticing the difference (100% compatible).
 *     (Implemented as svn_wc__wrap_diff_callbacks())
 *
 *   * It should provide the information that was missing in the old interface,
 *     but required to close existing issues.
 *
 *     E.g. - properties and children on deleted directories.
 *          - revision numbers and copyfrom information on directories.
 *
 * To cleanup the implementation and make it easier on diff processors to
 * handle the results I also added the following constraints.
 *
 *   * Diffs should be fully reversible: anything that is deleted should be
 *     available, just like something that is added.
 *     (Proven via svn_diff__tree_processor_reverse_create)
 *     ### Still in doubt if *_deleted() needs a copy_to argument, for the
 *     ### 99% -> 100%.
 *
 *   * Diff processors should have an easy way to communicate that they are
 *     not interested in certain expensive to obtain results.
 *
 *   * Directories should have clear open and close events to allow adding them
 *     before their children, but still allowing property changes to have
 *     defined behavior.
 *
 *   * Files and directories should be handled as similar as possible as in
 *     many cases they are just nodes in a tree.
 *
 *   * It should be easy to create diff wrappers to apply certain transforms.
 *
 * During the creation an additional requirement of knowing about 'some
 * absent' nodes was added, to allow the merge to work on just this processor
 * api.
 *
 * The api describes a clean open-close walk through a tree, depending on the
 * driver multiple siblings can be described at the same time, but when a
 * directory is closed all descendants are done.
 *
 * Note that it is possible for nodes to be described as a delete followed by
 * an add at the same place within one parent. (Iff the diff is reversed you
 * can see an add followed by a delete!)
 *   ### "An add followed by a delete" sounds wrong.
 *
 * The directory batons live between the open and close events of a directory
 * and are thereby guaranteed to outlive the batons of their descendants.
