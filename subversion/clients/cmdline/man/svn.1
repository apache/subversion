.TH svn 1 "22 Jan 2002" "svn 0.9" "Subversion Command Line Tool"
.SH NAME
svn \- Subversion command line tool
.SH SYNOPSIS
.TP
\fBsvn\fP \fIcommand\fP [\fIoptions\fP] [\fIargs\fP]
.SH NOTE
This manpage should cover all the features of the \fBsvn\fP command line
tool. This is still a very early version. It lacks documentation, it includes
not yet support features and it is generally still in a bad shape.  Beware.
.SH OVERVIEW
Subversion is a version control system, which allows you to keep old versions
of files (usually source code), keep a log of who, when, and why changes
occurred, etc., like CVS, RCS or SCCS.  \fBSubversion\fP keeps a single copy
of the master sources.  This copy is called the source ``repository''; it
contains all the information to permit extracting previous software releases
at any time.

More about \fBSubversion\fP as a general version control system is documented
elsewhere.

.SH COMMANDS
svn has many options. Remember to run
.B "svn help"
to display a list of all commands, and to request a help text for a particular
command, run
\fBsvn help command\fP.
.TP
\fBadd\fP \fIfile\fP\|.\|.\|.
Use this command to enroll new files in \fBsvn\fP records of your working
directory.  The files will be added to the repository the next time you run
"svn commit". Note: You should use the "svn import" command to bootstrap new
sources into the source repository. "svn add" is only used for adding new
files to an already checked-out module.

\fBexample:\fP svn add foo.c bar.h baz/ bat/*.m
.TP
\fBcheckout\fP \fIrepository\fP\|.\|.\|.
(Alias: co)
A necessary preliminary for most \fBsvn\fP work: creates your private copy of
the source for \fIrepository\fP (the repository must be identified with a valid
URL string). You can work with this copy without interfering with others'
work.  At least one subdirectory level is always created.

-d/--destination can be used to specify target dir, if the filepart of the URL
is not what you want.

\fBexample:\fP svn checkout http://site.com/repo/svn -d targetdir
.TP
\fBcleanup\fP \fItarget\fP\|.\|.\|.
Recursively clean up the working copy, removing locks, resuming
unfinished operations, etc.
.TP
\fBcommit\fP \fIfile\fP\|.\|.\|.
(Alias: ci)
Use this command when you wish to ``post'' your changes to other
developers, by incorporating them into the source repository.

-m/--message can be used to specify commit message on the command line.

-F/--msg-file can be used to specify from which file to read the pre-written
commit message.

\fBexample:\fP svn commit foo.c bar.h baz/ bat/*.m
.TP
\fBcopy\fP \fIsource destination\fP (Alias: cp) Where \fBsource\fP and
\fBdestination\fP can be directories or files, local ones in a repository or
remote ones specified as URLs. `copy' is used where you want to make a copy of
\fBsource\fP so that \fBdestination\fP will share ancestry of
\fBsource\fP. Unless \fBdestination\fP is a directory, \fBdestination\fP must
not exist (In the spirit of unix cp, \fBsource\fP will be placed inside of
\fBdestination\fP if \fBdestination\fP is a directory).

\fBexample:\fP If you do this (MAINTAIN ANCESTRY)

  $ svn copy foo.c bar.c

Then foo.c and bar.c will share a common ancestor in the repository.

\fBexample:\fP But, if you do this (NO ANCESTRY)

  $ cp foo.c bar.c 
  $ svn add bar.c
  $ svn ci -m "Initial Import"

Then you will have the identical file in your working copy, but bar.c will
have no revision history beyond the initial import that you just did.

\fBexample:\fP Make a new copy from a remote source

  $ svn cp http://rep.com/repo/path/bar.c foo.c
  $ svn ci -m "copied that remote bar.c here"
.TP
\fBdelete\fP \fIfile|dir\fP\|.\|.\|.
(Alias: del, remove, rm) Mark the given files/directories for deletion upon
commit. When you commit, the entries will be removed from the head revision in
the repository, and deleted from your working copy.

\fBexample:\fP svn delete foo.c bar.h
.TP
\fBdiff\fP \fI[target...]\fP.
Display file changes as contextual diffs. The target can be a
directory, in which it operates recursively. The target can be an URL,
although this is only useful if two revisions are also given.

-r/--revision with a single revision causes comparison with the
specified repository revision. With two revisions the comparison is
between the two specified repository revisions. If this option is not
given the comparison is between the working copy and its current
repository revision.

-n/--nonrecursive with a directory target will prevent recursive
descent into subdirectories.

\fBexample:\fP svn diff README

Compares the working copy version of the file with current repository
version.

\fBexample:\fP svn diff -rHEAD README

Compares the working copy with most recent repository version.

\fBexample:\fP svn diff -r123:456 README

Compares revisions 123 and 456 of the file in the repository.

\fBexample:\fP
  svn diff -r123:456 http://rep.com/repo/README

Compare revisions 123 and 456 of the file in the repository without
the need for a working copy.

.TP
\fBhelp\fP [\fIcommand\fP]
(Alias: ?, h)
Without a given command argument, this prints generic help. If a specific
command is entered, a short description on how to use that command is
presented.
.TP
\fBimport\fP \fIRepository-URL\fP [\fIPath\fP] [\fINew-Repository-Entry\fP]
Import a file or tree into the repository.
.TP
\fBinfo\fP \fItarget1\fP [\fItarget2\fP ...]
Print info about a versioned resource.
.TP
\fBlog\fP [\fIurl\fP] [\fIfile|dir\fP]
Show log messages (and affected entities) for commits in which any of the
entities in question changed.  If none were specified, then recursive
inclusion is the default.  The set of messages can be further restricted
by a date or revision range specification (using -d or -r). A URL can also
be specific to retrieve logs from a remote repository. If the URL is
passed alone, then only that entry will be searched. If paths are also
supplied with the URL, then only those paths are searched, based at the
given URL.

\fBexample:\fP svn log

Recursively retrieve logs for all revision under "."

\fBexample:\fP svn log README

Retrieve logs for only those revisions where README was affected.

\fBexample:\fP svn log http://rep.com/repo/README

Retrieve logs for the file without the need for a local checkout of the
repository.

\fBexample:\fP svn log README LICENSE

Retrive logs for all revisions where both files were affected.

\fBexample:\fP svn log http://rep.com/repo README LICENSE

Retrieve logs for both files in the remote repository without the need for
a local checkout of the repository.

.TP
\fBmkdir\fP [\fIdirectory...\fP]
Create the directory(ies), if they do not already exist. The directories can
be specified as a local directory name, or as a URL.
.TP
\fBmove\fP [\fISOURCE\fP] [\fIDEST\fP]
Rename SOURCE to DEST, or move SOURCE(s) to DIRECTORY. Both source and dest
can be specified either as a local file name, or as a URL in a possibly remote
repository.
.TP
\fBpropdel\fP \fIpropname\fP [\fItargets\fP]
(Alias: pdel)
Remove property \fIpropname\fP on files and directories.
.TP

.TP
\fBproplist\fP [\fItargets\fP]

.TP
\fBrevert\fP [\fIfile\fP\|.\|.\|.]

.TP
\fBstatus\fP [\fItargets\fP]
(Alias: stat, st)

-n/--nonrecursive.
.TP
\fBupdate\fP [\fIfile\fP\|.\|.\|.]
(Alias: up)
Execute this command from \fIwithin\fP your private source directory when you
wish to update your copies of source files from changes that other developers
have made to the source in the repository. Without a given argument, this
command will update everything, recursively.

\fBexample:\fP svn update foo.c bar.h baz/ bat/*.m
