This Software should compile and run under win32 and linux. The 
integration into the subversion build system has been done by
Justin Erenkrantz for non win32 systems. The intergration for win32
system will be provided later.

It will produce libsvnjavahl.so or libsvnjavahl.dll (the native
library for Unix or win32, respectively) and svnjavahl.jar (platform
independent archive of Java bytecode).

For build non win32 platforms, add "--enable-javahl" to the configure 
parameters. "--with-jdk" can be provided to specify the path to a jdk.
"--with-junit" can be provided to specify the path to a junit.jar. 
JUnit version 3.8.1 has been tested. 

The following make target are provided:

javahl                build javahl
install-javahl        install javahl
check-javahl          run javahl tests. JUnit and installation is needed.

MacOS X:
After building libsvnjavahl.dynlib it has to be renamed to libsvnjavahl.jnilib.

Windows:

You need the bin directory of the JDK (>= 1.2) in your path and the include
and the include\win32 directory have to be in the include path of your visual
studio.

To build use the project/target "__JAVAHL__" of the main subversion workspace.
The private project/workspace is not used anymore.
