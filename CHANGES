                              NOTICES:

       This release is to correct for the problems in the 0.35.0
       release and affects Windows users only:

       * fix: file handle leak (r8048)

Version 0.35.0 (branching 12 December 2003, from revision 7994)
http://svn.collab.net/repos/svn/branches/0.35.0

                              NOTICES:

    1. As of this release, Subversion once again does deltification
       automatically.  This means that the deltification step most
       repositories introduced into their post-commit hooks as of
       release 0.33.0 should now be reverted.  Look for a line with
       "svnadmin deltify" in hooks/post-commit, and remove it.

    2. We now recommend using Berkeley DB 4.2.52 or higher for SVN
       repositories.  See http://sleepycat.com/download/index.shtml.

 User-visible changes:
 * BDB log files are automatically pruned, with BDB 4.2.50 and higher (#1615)
 * deltification is automatic again (issue #1601)
 * fix: svn diff -rX:Y wcpath' may lie (issue #1616)
 * fix: URI-decoding problem on 'svn import' (issue #1622)
 * many other enhancements, minor features, and bugfixes not listed here


 Developer-visible changes:

## To  upgrade,   first  use  'svnadmin dump'  with  your existing ##
## Subversion binaries.   Then upgrade your binaries to 0.34,  and ##
## use  'svnadmin load'  to  create  a  new  repository  from your ##

Version 0.33.1 (released 17 November 2003, revision r7782)
http://svn.collab.net/repos/svn/tags/0.33.1

    NOTICE: This is a bugfix release.  The bug is fixed if *either*
            the client or server uses the new code.

User-visible changes:

Version 0.33.0 (released 13 November 2003, revision r7737)
http://svn.collab.net/repos/svn/tags/0.33.0

                              NOTICES:

    1. This client may be incompatible with ra_dav servers <= 0.31.

    2. In order to make commits more responsive, repository
       deltification is no longer automatic.  However, you may want
       to run deltification as a background process in your repository
       post-commit hook.  For example, the new post-commit.tmpl file
       recommends 'nice -2 svnadmin deltify "$REPOS" -r "$REV" &'.

 * now require APR/APU 0.9.5 (ships in Apache 2.0.48)

 * new configuration and authn/authz support in ra_svn (r7604, r7601)
 * much faster checkouts and updates, over both svn:// and http:// (#1429)

 * new 'use-commit-times = yes' config option to use commit-time timestamps
 * new 'svnadmin hotcopy' command, like hot-backup.py (#1567)
 * fix Win32 "access denied" error in renames (r7598, #1576)
 * unnecessary working copy tree locks now avoided, to save time (#1245)
 * Compatibility changes:
    - lose ra_dav compatibility with servers 0.31 and earlier
    - lose support for working copy format "1" (not created for over a year)
 * 'svn diff' and other read-only actions now work in read-only working copies
 * 'svn blame -rX' now does the intuitive thing
 * 'svn log' output headers now say "rXXXX | " instead of "rev XXXX:  "
 * 'svnversion' no longer stymied by svn:externals
 * new 'svn pd' alias for 'svn propdel'
 * '-rCOMMITTED' keyword now works on more commands
 * minor changes to output of 'svn ls -v' and 'svn st -v' (r7530)
 * 'svn log --xml' now obeys the '-q' flag (r7555)
 * cvs2svn.py bugfixes, especially issue #1440
 * book and documentation updates
 * removed server config options ssl-ignore-invalid-date and
   ssl-override-cert-hostname (r7644)
 * many other enhancements, minor features, and bugfixes not listed here

 Developer-visible changes:
 * repair text- and prop-time in .svn/entries if spuriously wrong (r7565)
 * speed up keyword translation (r7502)
 * two new editor functions, absent_file() and absent_directory()

Version 0.28.2 (released 29 Aug 2003, revision 6946)
http://svn.collab.net/repos/svn/tags/0.28.2

      The new history-searching code was over-stressing our use
      of BerkeleyDB transactions, causing checkouts to go
      twice as slow and lose all concurrent-client scalability.

      This is a temporary fix for a larger design problem.  See issue
      http://subversion.tigris.org/issues/show_bug.cgi?id=1499


Version 0.28.1
(released 28 Aug 2003,http://svn.collab.net/repos/svn/tags/0.28.1)

  There are no changes in this release.
  It is strictly an updated release, build with the correct version
  of autoconf; autconf-2.57


Version 0.28.0 (released 27 August 2003, rev 6894, branches/release-0.28)
