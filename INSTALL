I.    BUILD REQUIREMENTS
      ==================

      Subversion depends on a number of third party tools and libraries.
      If you are bootstrapping from a tarball, zipfile or an RPM then
      you will already have everything you require to get a Subversion
      client.  So long as you don't plan to build a new client from the
      latest source or to build a Subversion server, you can go directly
      to section II.A.

      Otherwise, you need to read the following so that you can determine
      what other tools and libraries will be required so that Subversion
      can be built with the set of features you want.

      On Unix systems, the './configure' script will tell you if you are
      missing the correct version of any of the required libraries or
      tools, so if you are in a real hurry to get building, you can skip
      straight to section II.  If you want to gather the pieces you will
      need before starting out, however, you should read the following.

      Note: Because previous builds of Subversion may have installed older
      versions of these libraries, you may want to run some of the cleanup
      commands described in section II.B before installing the following.


      1.  Apache Portable Runtime 0.9.5 (http://apr.apache.org/)

      Whenever you want to build any part of Subversion, you need the
      Apache Portable Runtime (APR) and the APR Utility (APR-util)
      libraries. These are included in Subversion source tarball releases -
      if you are building from a source tarball, and wish to use the
      included versions, you may skip ahead to the next requirement.

      If you are not building from a tarball, you will need to get these
      yourself. Visit this page, and be sure to download the 0.9.x version:

          http://apr.apache.org/download.cgi

      On Unix systems, if you already have the APR libraries compiled and do
      not wish to regenerate them from source code, then Subversion needs to
      be able to find them.

      There are a couple of options to "./configure" that tell it where
      to look for the APR and APR-util libraries. By default, it will first
      look for bundled versions of APR and APR-util, and then try to locate
      already installed versions of the libraries using the apr-config and
      apu-config scripts. These scripts provide all the relevant information
      for the APR and APR-util installations.

      If you want to specify the location of the APR library, you can use
      the "--with-apr=" option of "./configure". It should be able to find
      the apr-config script in the standard location under that directory
      (e.g. ${prefix}/bin).

      Similarly, you can specify the location of APR-util using the
      "--with-apr-util=" option to "./configure". It will look for the
      apu-config script relative to that directory.

      For example, if you want to use the APR libraries you built
      with the Apache httpd 2.0 server, you could run:

          $ ./configure --with-apr=/usr/local/apache2 \
            --with-apr-util=/usr/local/apache2  ...

      If you want Subversion to build the APR libraries from source
      code as part of the Subversion build process, you can put their
      source code into the "./apr" and "./apr-util" directories.

      You don't need the latest development versions, since Subversion is
      guaranteed to compile against the latest released APR and APR-util.
      However, if you really want to, you can use the following two
      commands. If you run them from the directory where you've checked out
      Subversion, then the APR source code will be in "./apr" and
      "./apr-util", where Subversion wants it:

      $ svn co \
        http://svn.apache.org/repos/asf/apr/apr/branches/0.9.x apr
      $ svn co \
        http://svn.apache.org/repos/asf/apr/apr-util/branches/0.9.x apr-util

      NOTE: On Windows you will also need apr-iconv.  Check it out next to
      the apr and apr-util directories:
      
      $ svn co \
        http://svn.apache.org/repos/asf/apr/apr-iconv/branches/0.9.x apr-iconv

      Be sure to use a native Windows SVN client (as opposed to
      Cygwin's version) so that the .dsp files get carriage-returns at
      the ends of their lines.  Otherwise Visual Studio will complain
      that it doesn't recognize the .dsp files.


      2.  autoconf 2.50 or newer (Unix only)

      This is required only if you plan to build from the latest source
      (see section II.B). Generally only developers would be doing this.


      3.  libtool 1.4 or newer (Unix only)

      This is required only if you plan to build from the latest source
      (see section II.B).

      Note: Some systems (Solaris, for example) require libtool 1.4.3 or
      newer. The autogen.sh script knows about that.


      4.  Neon library 0.24.7 (http://www.webdav.org/neon/)

      The Neon library allows a Subversion client to interact with remote
      repositories over the Internet via a WebDAV based protocol.  If you 
      want to use Subversion to connect to a server over ra_dav (via a 
      http:// or https:// url), you will require Neon.  

      The Neon library source code can be installed in "./neon" if you
      want Subversion to build it as part of the Subversion build process.
      The source code is included with the latest Subversion tarball, and it
      can also be obtained from:

          http://www.webdav.org/neon/neon-0.24.7.tar.gz

      Unpack the archive using tar/gunzip and rename the resulting
      directory from "./neon-0.24.7/" to "./neon/".

      Without source code, a previously compiled library can be picked up
      from the standard locations. If you want to specify a nonstandard
      location, you need to use the LDFLAGS environment variable when
      you run "./configure". You may also have to specify where the
      neon-config script (which identifies various features of the Neon
      library) is kept by giving the "--with-neon=" option to
      "./configure". Note that the script should be kept in a "bin"
      subdirectory beneath wherever "--with-neon" is pointed.


      5.  Berkeley DB 4.X

      Berkeley DB is needed to build a Subversion server that supports
      the bdb repository filesystem, or to access a bdb repository on
      local disk.  If you will only use the fsfs repository filesystem,
      or if you are building a Subversion client that will only speak
      to remote (networked) repositories, you don't need it.

      The current recommended version is 4.2.52. Version 4.3 has been
      recently released, but APR-util 0.9.x has not been updated to support
      it. We *strongly* recommend using 4.2 over 4.1 or 4.0.  Not only is
      the fastest and most stable version we've seen, but it also enables
      Subversion repositories to automatically clean up database journal
      files to save disk space.

      You'll need Berkeley DB installed on your system.  You can
      get it from:

          http://www.sleepycat.com/download/index.shtml

      If you have Berkeley DB installed in a place not searched by default
      for includes and libraries, add something like this:

          --with-berkeley-db=/usr/local/BerkeleyDB.4.2

      to your `configure' switches, and the build process will use the
      Berkeley library in the named directory.  You may need to use a
      different path, of course.

      If you are on the Windows platform and want to build Subversion,
      a precompiled version of the Berkeley DB library is available for
      download at the Subversion web site:

          http://subversion.tigris.org/servlets/ProjectDocumentList


      6.  Apache Web Server 2.0.49 or newer
          (http://httpd.apache.org/download.cgi)

      The Apache httpd server is one of two methods to make your Subversion
      repository available over a network - the other is a custom server
      program called svnserve, which requires no extra software packages.
      Building Subversion, the Apache server, and the modules that Apache
      needs to communicate with Subversion are complicated enough that there
      is a whole section at the end of this document that describes how it
      is done: See section III for details.


      7.  Python 2.0 (http://www.python.org/)

      If you want to run "make check" or build from the latest source
      under Unix as described in section II.B and III.D, install
      Python 2.0 or higher on your system. The majority of the test
      suite is written in Python, as is part of Subversion's build
      system.  Note that compiling under Windows requires Python 2.2
      or newer.


      8.  Visual C++ 6.0 or newer (Windows Only)

      To build Subversion under any of the MS Windows platforms, you
      will need a copy of Microsoft Visual C++.  You can generate the
      project files using the gen-make.py script.


      9. Perl 5.8 or newer (Windows only)

      To build Subversion under any of the MS Windows platforms, you
      will also need Perl 5.8 or newer to run apr-util's w32locatedb.pl
      script.


      10. Libraries for our libraries

      Some of the libraries that Subversion depends on themselves have
      optional dependencies that can add features to what Subversion
      can do.  Here are some examples.

      The Neon library has support for SSL encryption by relying on the
      OpenSSL library.  When Neon is created with this dependency, then
      the Subversion client inherits the ability to support SSL
      connections.  Neon also has support for sending compressed data
      using the zlib library which a Subversion client can take
      advantage of.

      On Unix systems, if you are building neon as part of the Subversion
      build process (as described in section I.4 above), you can pass flags
      to Subversion's "./configure", and they will be passed on to neon's
      "./configure".  You need OpenSSL installed on your system, and you
      must add "--with-ssl" as a "./configure" parameter.  If your OpenSSL
      installation is hard for Neon to find, you may need to use
      "--with-libs=/path/to/lib" in addition.  In particular, on Red Hat
      (but not Fedora Core) it is necessary to specify
      "--with-libs=/usr/kerberos" for OpenSSL to be found.  The zlib library
      is included in Neon by default, but you can also specify a path to the
      library using "--with-libs".  Consult the Neon documentation for more
      information on how to use these parameters and versions of libraries
      you need.

      Under Windows, you can specify the paths to these libraries by
      passing the options --with-zlib and --with-openssl to gen-make.py.

      You can also add support for these features to an Apache httpd server
      to be used for Subversion using the same support libraries.  The
      Subversion build system will not provide them, however.  You add them
      by specifying parameters to the "./configure" script of the Apache
      Server instead.

      For getting SSL on your server, you would add the "--enable-ssl"
      or "--with-ssl=/path/to/lib" option to Apache's "./configure"
      script.  Apache enables zlib support by default, but you can
      specify a nonstandard location for the library with the
      "--with-z=/path/to/dir" option.  Consult the Apache documentation
      for more details, and for other modules you may wish to install
      to enhance your Subversion server.

      If you don't already have it, you can get a copy of OpenSSL,
      including instructions for building and packaging on both Unix
      systems and Windows, at:

          http://www.openssl.org/

      Many Unix systems already come with zlib, but if you need it, it
      is available from:

          http://www.gzip.org/zlib/

      Windows users should just get the pre-built package:

          http://www.gzip.org/zlib/contrib/zlib113-win32.zip

      The neon build scripts on Windows are set up to use those
      libraries.


      11. Building The Documentation

      The master source format for Subversion's documentation is
      Docbook Lite.  See doc/book/README for instructions how to
      compile the book into a useful format.

      The preferred documentation source format used to be Texinfo. We are
      in the process of migrating all texinfo files to DocBook Lite. The
      online documentation for texinfo is at

      http://www.gnu.org/manual/texinfo-4.0/html_chapter/texinfo_toc.html

      Depending on exactly which doc targets you make, you'll need one
      or more of:

         * the `makeinfo' program from the latest texinfo package in
           ftp://ftp.gnu.org/pub/gnu/texinfo/

         * the `texi2dvi' or `texi2html' programs

         * the `dvipdf' script from Ghostscript (pipes dvi | ps |
                                                 Ghostscript)

      If `makeinfo' is not installed before `configure' is run, then
      the documentation which requires it will not be created and installed.



II.   INSTALLATION
      ============

  A.  Building from a Tarball or RPM
      ------------------------------

      1.  Building from a Tarball

      Download the most recent distribution tarball from:

          http://subversion.tigris.org/servlets/ProjectDocumentList

      Unpack it, and use the standard GNU procedure to compile:

          $ ./configure
          $ make
          # make install

      You can also run the full test suite by running 'make check'.      


      2.  Building from an RPM

      If you are using Linux (or any OS that can use RPM) then another
      possibility is to download the binary RPM from the
      http://summersoft.fay.ar.us/pub/subversion directory.

      Currently only Linux on the i386 platform is supported
      using this method.  You might also require additional RPMS
      (which can be found in the above mentioned directory) to use the
      subversion RPM depending on what packages you already have installed:

          subversion*.i386.rpm
          apache*.i386.rpm (Version 2.0.49 or greater)
          db*.i386.rpm     (Version 4.0.14 or greater; version 4.2.52 is
                            preferred however)
          expat            (Comes with RedHat)
          neon             (Version 0.24.7)

      After downloading, install it (as root user):

          # rpm -ivh subversion*.386.rpm (add other packages as necessary)

      Note: For an easy way to generate a new version of the RPM
      source and binary package from the latest source code you
      just checked out, see the packages/rpm/README file for a
      one-line build procedure.


  B.  Building the Latest Source under Unix
      -------------------------------------

      These instructions assume you have already installed Subversion
      and checked out a working copy of Subversion's own code --
      either the latest /trunk code, or some branch or tag.

      You can discard the directory created by the tarball; you're
      about to build the latest, greatest Subversion client.  This is
      the procedure Subversion developers use.

      First off, if you have any Subversion libraries lying around
      from previous 'make installs', clean them up first!

          # rm -f /usr/local/lib/libsvn*
          # rm -f /usr/local/lib/libapr*
          # rm -f /usr/local/lib/libexpat*
          # rm -f /usr/local/lib/libneon*

      Start the process by running "autogen.sh":

          $ sh ./autogen.sh

      This script will make sure you have all the necessary components
      available to build Subversion.  If any are missing, you will be
      told where to get them from.  (See the 'Build Requirements' in
      section I.)

      Note: if the command "autoconf" on your machine does not run
      autoconf 2.50 or later, but you do have a new enough autoconf
      available, then you can specify the correct one with the
      AUTOCONF variable.  (The AUTOHEADER variable is similar.)  This
      may be required on Debian GNU/Linux, where "autoconf" is
      actually a Perl script that attempts to guess which version is
      required -- because of the interaction between Subversion's and
      APR's configuration systems, the Perl script may get it wrong.
      So for example, you might need to do:

          $ AUTOCONF=autoconf2.50 sh ./autogen.sh

      Once you've prepared the working copy by running autogen.sh,
      just follow the usual configuration and build procedure:

          $ ./configure
          $ make
          # make install

      (Optionally, you might want to pass --enable-maintainer-mode to
      the ./configure script.  This enables debugging symbols in your
      binaries (among other things) and most Subversion developers use it.)

      Unlike the pre-packaged tarball (which includes apr, apr-util,
      and neon subdirectories), ./configure will fail if it cannot
      find apr, apr-util, and neon libraries already installed on your
      system.

      Since the resulting binary depends on shared libraries, the
      destination library directory must be identified in your
      operating system's library search path. That is in either
      /etc/ld.so.conf or $LD_LIBRARY_PATH for Linux systems and in
      /etc/rc.conf for FreeBSD, followed by a run of the 'ldconfig'
      program. Check your system documentation for details. By
      identifying the destination directory, Subversion will be able
      to dynamically load repository access plugins.  If you try to do
      a checkout and see an error like:

      subversion/libsvn_ra/ra_loader.c:209: (apr_err=170000)
      svn: Unrecognized URL scheme 'http://svn.collab.net/repos/svn/trunk'

      It probably means that the dynamic loader/linker can't find all
      of the libsvn_* libraries.

      Note that if you commonly build with the -jN option to make, the
      make step above may fail, because we don't ensure that third
      party libraries in our source tree will finish building before
      subversion itself.  If you want to use -jN, use the following
      instead:

          $ ./configure
          $ make -jN external-all
          $ make -jN local-all
          $ make check
          # make install


  C.  Building under Unix in Different Directories
      --------------------------------------------

      It is possible to configure and build Subversion on Unix in a
      directory other than the working copy. For example

          $ svn co http://svn.collab.net/repos/svn/trunk svn
          $ cd svn
          $ # get neon/apr as required
          $ chmod +x autogen.sh
          $ ./autogen.sh
          $ mkdir ../obj
          $ cd ../obj
          $ ../svn/configure [...with options as appropriate...]
          $ make

      puts the Subversion working copy in the directory svn and builds
      it in a separate, parallel directory obj.

      Why would you want to do this? Well there are a number of
      reasons...

          *  You may prefer to avoid "polluting" the working copy with
             files generated during the build.

          *  You may want to put the build directory and the working
             copy on different physical disks to improve performance.

          *  You may want to separate source and object code and only
             backup the source.

          *  You may want to remote mount the working copy on multiple
             machines, and build for different machines from the same
             working copy.

          *  You may want to build multiple configurations from the
             same working copy.

      The last reason above is possibly the most useful.  For instance
      you can have separate debug and optimised builds each using the
      same working copy. Or you may want a client-only build and a
      client-server build. Using multiple build directories you can
      rebuild any or all configurations after an edit without the need
      to either clean and reconfigure, or identify and copy changes
      into another working copy.


  D.  Installing from a Zip or Installer File under Windows
      --------------------------------------------------------

      Of all the ways of getting a Subversion client, this is the
      easiest.  Download a Zip (*.zip) or self-extracting installer
      (*-setup.exe) file from:

      http://subversion.tigris.org/servlets/ProjectDocumentList?folderID=91

      For a Zip file, run your unzipping utility (WinZIP, ZipGenius,
      UltimateZIP, FreeZIP, whatever) and extract the DLLs and EXEs to
      a directory of your choice. Included in the download is the SVN
      client, the SVNADMIN administration tool, and the SVNLOOK
      reporting tool.

      To test the installation, open a DOS box (run either "cmd" or
      "command" from the Start menu's "Run..." menu option), change to
      the directory you installed the executables into, and run:

          C:\test>svn co http://svn.collab.net/repos/svn/trunk svn

      This will get the latest Subversion sources and put them into the
      "svn" subdirectory.

      If using a self-extracting .exe file, just run it instead of
      unzipping it, to install Subversion.


  E.  Building the Latest Source under Windows
      ----------------------------------------

  E.1 Prerequisites

      * Visual Studio 6 and service pack. It can be built with Visual Studio
        7 (aka Visual Studio.NET aka Visual Studio.NET 2002) but these
        instructions assumes VS6.
      * A recent Windows SDK, the one provided with Visual Studio 6 is
        too old. You only need the 'Core SDK'. You can get it from MSDN
        if you have it or from
        http://www.microsoft.com/msdownload/platformsdk/sdkupdate/ if you
        don't.
      * Python 2.2 or higher, downloaded from http://www.python.org/ which is
        used to generate the project files.
      * Perl 5.8 or higher from http://www.activestate.com/
      * Awk, from http://cm.bell-labs.com/cm/cs/who/bwk/awk95.exe
        This is needed to compile Apache or APR.  Note that this is the
        actual awk program, not an installer - just rename it to awk.exe
        and it is ready to use.
      * Neon 0.24.7 or higher, downloaded from
        http://www.webdav.org/neon/neon-0.24.7.tar.gz which is required
        for building the client components.  Neon is included in the zip file
        distribution.
      * Berkeley DB is required for support for local server components,
        version 4.2.52 is available from
        http://subversion.tigris.org/servlets/ProjectDocumentList as
        db-4.2.52-win32.zip. For more information see Section I.5.
      * Apache 2 source, downloaded from
        http://httpd.apache.org/download.cgi, these instructions assume
        version 2.0.50.  Only needed for building the server dso modules.
      * Apache 2 msi install file, also from
        http://httpd.apache.org/download.cgi (required for running the
        tests).  Only needed for testing the server dso modules.
      * Apache apr, apr-util, and apr-iconv libraries, version 0.9.5.
        Included in both the Subversion ZIP file and the Apache 2 source
        tarball.  If you are building from a Subversion checkout and have
        not downloaded Apache 2, then get these 3 libraries from
        http://www.apache.org/dist/apr/
      * ZLib 1.1.4 or higher (version 1.1.x) binaries
        http://www.winimage.com/zLibDll/zlib114dll.zip.
      * Openssl 0.9.7d or higher obtained from
        http://www.openssl.org/source/openssl-0.9.7d.tar.gz
      * An assembler, e.g., nasm which is available from
        http://www.kernel.org/pub/software/devel/nasm/binaries/win32/
      * For localization gnu gettext is needed.  Get
        gettext-runtime-0.13.bin.woe32.zip,
        gettext-tools-0.13.bin.woe32.zip, and
        libiconv-1.9.1.bin.woe32.zip from
        http://mirrors.kernel.org/gnu/gettext/ and
        http://mirrors.kernel.org/gnu/libiconv/.
      * Either a Subversion client binary from http://subversion.tigris.org/ to
        do the initial checkout of the Subversion source or the zip file
        source distribution. See the section "Bootstrapping from a Zip or
        Installer File under Windows" above for more.
      * A means of unpacking the files.  The Subversion tar.gz file uses the
        POSIX.1 standard for file names which exceed 100 characters.  This
        format is not understood by all programs which claim to be able to
        unpack .tar.gz files.  Notable examples of this are WinZip and the
        utilities which can be found at http://unxutils.sourceforge.net/.  The
        version of tar at http://gnuwin32.sourceforge.net/ is derived from GNU
        tar, so it can handle POSIX.1. However, it is *not* able to unpack
        gzip files, although it is able to read a pipe from gzip.  Cygwin can
        unpack this file, however cygwin is a large package to install such
        just to unpack the tarball on Windows.  To avoid these problems use
        the Subversion zip file source distribution.  The other required
        package which is packaged as a tar file (openssl) can be unpacked with
        any of the utilities mentioned.

   E.2 Notes

      The neon library supports secure connections with OpenSSL and
      on-the-wire compression with zlib. If you want to use those
      features, you should pass the options "--with-zlib" and
      "--with-openssl" to the gen-make.py script. See Section I.10 for
      more details.

      If you are installing under Win9x or NT4 (and do not have Internet
      Explorer 5 or later) and svn.exe doesn't run, try installing
      shfolder.dll from here (wrapped url):

          http://download.microsoft.com/download/platformsdk/Redist/
          5.50.4027.300/W9XNT4/EN-US/shfinst.EXE

   E.3 Preparation

      This section describes how to unpack the files to make a build tree.

      * Make a directory SVN and cd into it.
      * Either checkout Subversion:

          svn co http://svn.collab.net/repos/svn/trunk/ src-trunk

        or unpack the zip file distribution and rename the directory to
        src-trunk.

      * Install Visual Studio 6. You either have to tell the installer to
        register environment variables or run VCVARS32.BAT before building
        anything.
      * Install a recent Windows Core SDK
      * Register the SDK with Visual Studio 6. This is a quote from the
        Microsoft February 2003 SDK documentation:

       "To register the SDK bin, include, and library directories with
        Microsoft Visual Studio® version 6.0 and Visual Studio .NET,
        click Start, point to All Programs, point to Microsoft Platform
        SDK February 2003, point to Visual Studio Registration, and then
        click Register PSDK Directories with Visual Studio. This
        registration process places the SDK bin, include, and library
        directories at the beginning of the search paths, which ensures
        that the latest headers and libraries are used when building
        applications in the IDE. Note that for Visual Studio 6.0
        integration to succeed, Visual Studio 6.0 must run at least once
        before you select Register PSDK Directories with Visual
        Studio. Also note that when this option is run, the IDEs should
        not be running."

      * Install Python and add it to your path
      * Install Perl (it should add itself to the path)
      * Copy AWK (awk95.exe) to awk.exe (e.g. SVN\awk\awk.exe) and add
        the directory containing it (e.g. SVN\awk) to the path.
      * Install Apache 2 using the msi file if you are going to test the
        server dso modules.
      * If you checked out Subversion from the repository then extract neon
        into SVN\src-trunk\neon, the zip file source distribution includes
        neon.
      * Extract the Berkeley DB files into SVN\src-trunk\db4-win32. It's a
        good idea to add SVN\src-trunk\db4-win32\bin to your PATH, so that
        Subversion can find the Berkeley DB DLLs.

        [NOTE: This binary package of Berkeley DB is provided for
            convenience only. Please don't address questions about
            Berkeley DB that aren't directly related to using Subversion
            to the project mailing list.]

        If you build Berkeley DB from the source, you will have to copy
        the file db-4.2.52\build_win32\db.h to
        SVN\src-trunk\db4-win32\include, and all the import libraries to
        SVN\src-trunk\db4-win32\lib. Again, the DLLs should be somewhere in
        your path.

      * Extract Apache source into SVN\http-2.0.50 if you wish to build the
        server dso modules.
      * If you are building from a checkout of Subversion, and you are NOT
        building Apache, then you will need the APR libraries.  Depending
        on how you got your version of APR, either:
          - Extract the APR, APR-util and APR-iconv source distributions into
            SVN\apr, SVN\apr-util, and SVN\apr-iconv respectively.
        Or:
          - Extract the apr, apr-util and apr-iconv directories from the
            srclib folder in the Apache httpd source into SVN\apr,
            SVN\apr-util, and SVN\apr-iconv respectively.
      * Extract the pre-built zlib into SVN\zlib and copy
        SVN\zlib\static32\zlibstat.lib into SVN\zlib
      * Extract openssl into SVN\openssl-0.9.7d
      * Extract nasm into SVN\nasm and put it in your path
      * Make a directory SVN\gettext and unpack
        gettext-runtime-0.13.bin.woe32.zip,
        gettext-tools-0.13.bin.woe32.zip, and
        libiconv-1.9.1.bin.woe32.zip into it.  Add SVN\gettext\bin to your
        path, SVN\gettext\include to your INCLUDE path and
        SVN\gettext\lib to your LIB path environment variables.  You can
        add these on the command line as shown below.

   E.4 Building the Binaries

    To build the binaries either follow the instructions here or use
    build\win32\vc6-build.bat.in after editing it's default paths to match
    yours and saving it as vc6-build.bat.  The vc6-build.bat does a full build
    so it requires Apache 2 source and if the tests are to be run the 
    Apache 2 install.

    Start in the SVN directory you created.

    Set up the environment (commands should be one line even if wrapped here).

    C:>set VER=trunk
    C:>set DIR=trunk
    C:>set DRIVE=C
    C:>set PYTHONDIR=C:\Python22
    C:>set AWKDIR=C:\SVN\Awk
    C:>set NASMDIR=C:\SVN\nasm
    C:>set SDKINC=C:\Program Files\Microsoft SDK\include
    C:>set SDKLIB=C:\Program Files\Microsoft SDK\lib
    C:>set GETTEXTINC=C:\SVN\gettext\include
    C:>set GETTEXTLIB=C:\SVN\gettext\lib
    C:>set GETTEXTBIN=C:\SVN\gettext\bin
    C:>PATH=%PATH%;%DRIVE%:\SVN\src-%DIR%\db4-win32;%NASMDIR%;
            %PYTHONDIR%;%AWKDIR%;%GETTEXTBIN%
    C:>set INCLUDE=%SDKINC%;%INCLUDE%;%GETTEXTINC%
    C:>set LIB=%SDKLIB%;%LIB%;%GETTEXTLIB%

    OpenSSL

    C:>cd openssl-0.9.7d
    C:>perl Configure VC-WIN32
    C:>call ms\do_nasm
    C:>nmake -f ms\ntdll.mak
    C:>cd out32dll
    C:>call ..\ms\test
    C:>cd ..\..

    Apache 2

    This step is only required for building the server dso modules.

    The Subversion gen-make.py script must be run before building Apache or
    Apache and Subversion will be running incompatible versions of apr.

    C:>cd src-%DIR%
    C:>python gen-make.py -t dsp --with-httpd=..\httpd-2.0.50
       --with-berkeley-db=db4-win32 --with-openssl=..\openssl-0.9.7d
       --with-zlib=..\zlib --enable-nls --enable-bdb-in-apr-util
    C:>cd ..
    C:>set APACHEDIR=C:\Program Files\Apache Group\Apache2
    C:>msdev httpd-2.0.50\apache.dsw /MAKE "BuildBin - Win32 Release"

    Subversion

    Things to note:

      * If you don't want to build mod_dav_svn, omit the --with-httpd
        option.  The zip file source distribution contains apr, apr-util and
        apr-iconv in the default build location. If you have downloaded the
        apr files yourself you will have to tell the generator where to find
        the APR libraries; the options are --with-apr, --with-apr-util and
        --with-apr-iconv.
      * If you would like a debug build substitute Debug for Release in
        the msdev commands.
      * There have been rumors that Subversion on Win32 can be built
        using the latest cygwin, you probably don't want the zip file source
        distribution though. ymmv.
      * The /USEENV switch to msdev makes it take notice of the INCLUDE and
        LIB environment variables, it also makes it ignore it's own lib and
        include settings so you need to have the Windows SDK lib and include
        directories in the LIB and INCLUDE environment variables.  Do *not*
        use this switch when starting up the msdev Visual environment.  If you
        wish to build in the Visual environment the SDK lib and include
        directories must be in the Tools/Options/Directories settings (if you
        followed the 'Register the SDK with Visual Studio 6' instructions
        above this has been done for you).
      * If you are using Visual Studio .NET change -t dsw into -t vcproj on
        the gen-make.py command.  In this case you will also have to
        distribute the C runtime dll with the binaries.
      * If the server dso modules are being built and tested Apache must not
        be running or the copy of the dso modules will fail.

    C:>cd src-%DIR%

    If Apache 2 has been built and the server modules are required then
    gen-make.py will already have been run. If the source is from the zip
    file, Apache 2 has not been built so gen-make.py must be run:

    C:>python gen-make.py -t dsp --with-berkeley-db=db4-win32
        --with-openssl=..\openssl-0.9.7d --with-zlib=..\zlib --enable-nls
        --enable-bdb-in-apr-util

    Then build subversion:

    C:>msdev subversion_msvc.dsw /USEENV /MAKE "__ALL_TESTS__ - Win32 Release"
    C:>cd ..

    Or, with Visual C++.NET:

    C:>devenv subversion_vcnet.sln /USEENV /build "Debug"
        /project "__ALL_TESTS__"
    C:>cd ..

    The binaries have now been built.

   E.5 Packaging the binaries

    You now need to copy the binaries ready to make the release zip
    file. You also need to do this to run the tests as the new binaries
    need to be in your path.

    From within the SVN directory copy these files:

    C:>mkdir svn-win32-%VER%
    C:>mkdir svn-win32-%VER%\bin
    C:>mkdir svn-win32-%VER%\httpd
    C:>mkdir svn-win32-%VER%\iconv
    C:>copy src-%DIR%\db4-win32\bin\libdb42.dll svn-win32-%VER%\bin
    C:>copy openssl-0.9.7d\out32dll\libeay32.dll svn-win32-%VER%\bin
    C:>copy openssl-0.9.7d\out32dll\ssleay32.dll svn-win32-%VER%\bin
    C:>copy gettext\bin\intl.dll svn-win32-%VER%\bin
    C:>copy gettext\bin\iconv.dll svn-win32-%VER%\bin
    C:>copy src-%DIR%\Release\subversion\clients\cmdline\svn.exe
       svn-win32-%VER%\bin
    C:>copy src-%DIR%\Release\subversion\svnadmin\svnadmin.exe
       svn-win32-%VER%\bin
    C:>copy src-%DIR%\Release\subversion\svndumpfilter\svndumpfilter.exe
       svn-win32-%VER%\bin
    C:>copy src-%DIR%\Release\subversion\svnlook\svnlook.exe
       svn-win32-%VER%\bin
    C:>copy src-%DIR%\Release\subversion\svnserve\svnserve.exe
       svn-win32-%VER%\bin
    C:>copy src-%DIR%\Release\subversion\svnversion\svnversion.exe
       svn-win32-%VER%\bin

    If Apache 2 and the server modules were built:

    C:>copy httpd-2.0.50\srclib\apr\Release\libapr.dll svn-win32-%VER%\bin
    C:>copy httpd-2.0.50\srclib\apr-iconv\Release\libapriconv.dll
       svn-win32-%VER%\bin
    C:>copy httpd-2.0.50\srclib\apr-util\Release\libaprutil.dll
       svn-win32-%VER%\bin
    C:>copy httpd-2.0.50\srclib\apr-iconv\Release\iconv\*.so
       svn-win32-%VER%\iconv

    If the source is from the zip file, Apache 2 has not been built and the
    server modules are not required:

    C:>copy src-%DIR%\apr\Release\libapr.dll svn-win32-%VER%\bin
    C:>copy src-%DIR%\apr-iconv\Release\libapriconv.dll svn-win32-%VER%\bin
    C:>copy src-%DIR%\apr-util\Release\libaprutil.dll svn-win32-%VER%\bin
    C:>copy src-%DIR%\apr-iconv\Release\iconv\*.so svn-win32-%VER%\iconv

   E.6 Testing the Binaries

    The build process creates the binary test programs but it does not
    copy the client tests into the release test area.

    C:>cd src-%DIR%
    C:>mkdir Release\subversion\tests\clients
    C:>xcopy /S /Y subversion\tests\clients Release\subversion\tests\clients

    If the server dso modules  have been built then copy the dso files and
    dlls into the Apache modules directory.

    C:>copy Release\subversion\mod_dav_svn\mod_dav_svn.so "%APACHEDIR%"\modules
    C:>copy Release\subversion\mod_authz_svn\mod_authz_svn.so
       "%APACHEDIR%"\modules
    C:>copy svn-win32-%VER%\bin\intl.dll "%APACHEDIR%\bin"
    C:>copy svn-win32-%VER%\bin\iconv.dll "%APACHEDIR%\bin"
    C:>copy svn-win32-%VER%\bin\libdb42.dll "%APACHEDIR%\bin"
    C:>cd ..

    Put the svn-win32-trunk\bin directory at the start of your path so
    you run the newly built binaries and not another version you might
    have installed.

    Then run the client tests:

    C:>PATH=%DRIVE%:\SVN\svn-win32-%VER%\bin;%PATH%
    C:>cd src-%DIR%
    C:>python win-tests.py -c -r -v

    If the server dso modules were built configure Apache to use the
    mod_dav_svn and mod_authz_svn modules by making sure these lines appear
    uncommented in httpd.conf:

      LoadModule dav_module         modules/mod_dav.so
      LoadModule dav_fs_module      modules/mod_dav_fs.so
      LoadModule dav_svn_module     modules/mod_dav_svn.so
      LoadModule authz_svn_module   modules/mod_authz_svn.so

    And further down the file add location directives to point to the
    test repositories. Change the paths to the SVN directory you created
    (paths should be on one line even if wrapped here):

      <Location /repositories>
       DAV svn
       SVNParentPath C:/SVN/src-trunk/Release/subversion/tests/clients/cmdline/
                     repositories
      </Location>

      <Location /local_tmp/repos>
       DAV svn
       SVNPath c:/SVN/src-trunk/Release/subversion/tests/clients/cmdline/
               local_tmp/repos
      </Location>

    Then restart Apache and run the tests:

    C:>python win-tests.py -c -r -v -u http://localhost
    C:>cd ..

III.  BUILDING A SUBVERSION SERVER
      ============================

  A.  Setting Up Apache
      -----------------

      (Following the BOOTSTRAPPING FROM RPM procedures above will install and
      build the latest Subversion server for Linux RedHat 7.1, 7.2, and PPC
      Linux systems *IF* the apache-devel-2.0.41 or greater package is already
      installed when the SUBVERSION RPM is built.)


      1.  Obtaining and Installing Apache 2.0

      Subversion tries to compile against the latest released version
      of Apache httpd-2.0.  The easiest thing for you to do is
      download a source tarball of the latest release and unpack that.

      Alternately, if you'd rather use the latest SVN versions of
      everything, checkout the "httpd 2.0.x"  branch from apache.org.
      If you have questions about the Apache httpd 2.0 build, please consult
      the httpd install documentation:

          http://httpd.apache.org/docs-2.0/install.html

      Place this module wherever you wish; it's an independent project.
      
      $ svn co \
        http://svn.apache.org/repos/asf/httpd/httpd/branches/2.0.x httpd-2.0 

      Checkout the "apr" and "apr-util" modules into the srclib/ directory:

      $ cd httpd-2.0/srclib
      $ svn co \
        http://svn.apache.org/repos/asf/apr/apr/branches/0.9.x apr
      $ svn co \
        http://svn.apache.org/repos/asf/apr/apr-util/branches/0.9.x apr-util

      At the top of the httpd-2.0 tree:

          $ ./buildconf
          $ ./configure --enable-dav --enable-so --enable-maintainer-mode

      The first arg says to build mod_dav.

      The second arg says to enable shared module support which is needed
      for a typical compile of mod_dav_svn (see below).

      The third arg says to include debugging information.  If you
      built Subversion with --enable-maintainer-mode, then you should
      do the same for Apache; there can be problems if one was
      compiled with debugging and the other without.

      Note: if you have multiple db versions installed on your system,
      Apache might link to a different one than Subversion, causing
      failures when accessing the repository through Apache.  To prevent
      this from happening, you have to tell Apache which db version to
      use and where to find db.  Add --with-dbm=db4 and
      --with-berkeley-db=/usr/local/BerkeleyDB.4.2 to the configure
      line.  Make sure this is the same db as the one Subversion uses.
      This note assumes you have installed Berkeley DB 4.2.52
      at its default locations.  For more info about the db requirement,
      see section I.5.

      You may also want to include other modules in your build. Add
      --enable-ssl to turn on SSL support, and --enable-deflate to turn on
      compression support, for example.  Consult the Apache documentation
      for more details.

      All instructions below assume you configured Apache to install
      in its default location, /usr/local/apache2/; substitute
      appropriately if you chose some other location.

      Compile and install apache:

          $ make && make install


  B.  Making and Installing the Subversion Server
      -------------------------------------------

      Go back into your subversion working copy and run ./autogen.sh if
      you need to.  Then, assuming Apache httpd 2.0 is installed in the
      standard location, run:

          $ ./configure

      Note: do *not* configure subversion with "--disable-shared"!
      mod_dav_svn *must* be built as a shared library, and it will
      look for other libsvn_*.so libraries on your system.

      If you see a warning message that the build of mod_dav_svn is being
      skipped, this may be because you have Apache httpd 2.0 installed
      in a non-standard location.  You can use the "--with-apxs=" option
      to locate the apxs script:

          $ ./configure --with-apxs=/usr/local/apache2/bin/apxs

      Note: it *is* possible to build mod_dav_svn as a static library
      and link it directly into Apache. Possible, but painful. Stick
      with the shared library for now; if you can't, then ask.

          $ rm /usr/local/lib/libsvn*

      If you have old subversion libraries sitting on your system,
      libtool will link them instead of the `fresh' ones in your tree.
      Remove them before building subversion.

          $ make clean && make && make install

      After the make install, the Subversion shared libraries are in
      /usr/local/lib/.  mod_dav_svn.so should be installed in
      /usr/local/apache2/modules/.


      Section II.E explains how to build the server on Windows.


  C.  Configuring Apache for Subversion
      ---------------------------------

      The following section is an abbreviated version of the
      information in the Subversion Book
      (http://svnbook.red-bean.com).  Please read chapter 6 for more
      details.

      The following assumes you have already created a repository.
      For documentation on how to do that, see README.

      The following also assumes that you have modified
      /usr/local/apache2/conf/httpd.conf to reflect your setup.
      At a minimum you should look at the User, Group and ServerName
      directives.  Full details on setting up apache can be found at:
      http://httpd.apache.org/docs-2.0/

      First, your httpd.conf needs to load the mod_dav_svn module.
      Subversion's 'make install' target should automatically add this
      line for you.  But if apache gives you an error like "Unknown
      DAV provider: svn", then you may want to verify that this line
      exists in your httpd.conf:

         LoadModule dav_svn_module     modules/mod_dav_svn.so

      NOTE: if you built mod_dav as a dynamic module as well, make sure
      the above line appears after the one that loads mod_dav.so.

      Next, add this to the *bottom* of your httpd.conf:

      <Location /svn/repos>
          DAV svn
          SVNPath /absolute/path/to/repository
      </Location>

      This will give anyone unrestricted access to the repository.  If
      you want limited access, read or write, you add these lines to
      the Location block:

          AuthType Basic
          AuthName "Subversion repository"
          AuthUserFile /my/svn/user/passwd/file

      And:

          a) For a read/write restricted repository:

             Require valid-user

          b) For a write restricted repository:

             <LimitExcept GET PROPFIND OPTIONS REPORT>
                 Require valid-user
             </LimitExcept>

          c) For separate restricted read and write access:

             AuthGroupFile /my/svn/group/file

             <LimitExcept GET PROPFIND OPTIONS REPORT>
                 Require group svn_committers
             </LimitExcept>

             <Limit GET PROPFIND OPTIONS REPORT>
                 Require group svn_committers
                 Require group svn_readers
             </Limit>

      These are only a few simple examples.  For a complete tutorial
      on Apache access control, please consider taking a look at the
      tutorials found under "Security" on the following page:
      http://httpd.apache.org/docs-2.0/misc/tutorials.html

      In order for 'svn cp' to work (which is actually implemented as a
      DAV COPY command), mod_dav needs to be able to determine the
      hostname of the server.  A standard way of doing this is to use
      Apache's ServerName directive to set the server's hostname.  Edit
      your /usr/local/apache2/conf/httpd.conf to include:

      ServerName svn.myserver.org

      If you are using virtual hosting through Apache's NameVirtualHost
      directive, you may need to use the ServerAlias directive to specify
      additional names that your server is known by.

      If you have configured mod_deflate to be in the server, you can enable
      compression support for your repository by adding the following line
      to your Location block:

          SetOutputFilter DEFLATE


      NOTE: If you are unfamiliar with an Apache directive, or not exactly
      sure about what it does, don't hesitate to look it up in the
      documentation: http://httpd.apache.org/docs-2.0/mod/directives.html.

      NOTE: Make sure that the user 'nobody' (or whatever UID the
      httpd process runs as) has permission to read and write the
      Berkeley DB files!  This is a very common problem.


  D.  Running and Testing
      -------------------

      Fire up apache 2.0:

          $ /usr/local/apache2/bin/apachectl stop
          $ /usr/local/apache2/bin/apachectl start

      Check /usr/local/apache2/logs/error_log to make sure it started
      up okay.

      Try doing a network checkout from the repository:

          $ svn co http://localhost/svn/repos wc

      The most common reason this might fail is permission problems
      reading the repository db files.  If the checkout fails, make
      sure that the httpd process has permission to read and write to
      the repository.  You can see all of mod_dav_svn's complaints in
      the Apache error logfile, /usr/local/apache2/logs/error_log.

      To run the regression test suite for networked Subversion, see
      the instructions in subversion/tests/clients/cmdline/README.
      For advice about tracing problems, see "Debugging the server" in
      the HACKING file.


  E.  Alternative:  'svnserve' and ra_svn
      -----------------------------------

      An alternative network layer is libsvn_ra_svn (on the client
      side) and the 'svnserve' process on the server.  This is a
      simple network layer that speaks a custom protocol over plain
      TCP (documented in libsvn_ra_svn/protocol):

         $ svnserve -d     # becomes a background daemon
         $ svn checkout svn://localhost/usr/local/svn/repository

      You can use the "-r" option to svnserve to set a logical root
      for repositories, and the "-R" option to restrict connections to
      read-only access.  ("Read-only" is a logical term here; svnserve
      still needs write access to the database in this mode, but will
      not allow commits or revprop changes.)

      'svnserve' has built-in CRAM-MD5 authentication (so you can
      use non-system accounts), and can also be tunneled over SSH
      (so you can use existing system accounts).  Please read chapter
      6 in the Subversion Book (http://svnbook.red-bean.com) for
      details on these features.



IV.   PLATFORM-SPECIFIC ISSUES
      ========================

  A.  Windows XP
      ----------

      There is an error in the Windows XP TCP/IP stack which causes
      corruption in certain cases.  This problem is exposed only
      through ra_dav.

      The root of the matter is caused by duplicating file handles
      between parent and child processes.  The httpd Apache group
      explains this a lot better:

          http://www.apache.org/dist/httpd/binaries/win32/#xpbug

      And there's an item about this in the Subversion FAQ:

          http://subversion.tigris.org/faq.html#windows-xp-server

      The only known workaround for now is to update to Windows XP
      SP1 (or higher).


  B.  Mac OS X
      --------
      
      [TBD: Describe BDB 4.0.x problem]
