<h1 style="text-align: center;">The Subversion Build/Test Farm</h1>

<pre style="text-align: center;"
>$LastChangedDate$</pre>

<p>We are designing a build/test farm for Subversion, to test
portability more conveniently and consistently.  We hope this will
lead to fewer surprises at Release Candidate time.</p>

<p>This document describes the build farm.  The intended audiences
are:</p>

<ul>
   <li>People who want to join the build farm, by running Subversion
       builds on a box with a stable environment, and using the build
       farm client software to send result reports to the central
       server for publication.</li>

   <li>People who administer the central build server (CollabNet's
       operations team has volunteered to do this, as well as to run
       some of the clients).</li>

   <li>Developers who want to test a change's portability before
       committing it, using the build farm's "try with this patch"
       feature.</li>
</ul>

<div class="h2" id="overview" title="overview">
<h2>Overview</h2>

<p>We've tentatively decided to use <a
href="https://sourceforge.net/projects/buildbot/">BuildBot</a> for
build management software, in part because of its <a
href="http://buildbot.sourceforge.net/manual-0.7.0.html#try">TryScheduler</a>
feature, which lets a developer ask the question "What would happen
if I committed this patch right now?".  It runs the unit test suite
(across multiple build platforms) on the developer's current code,
allowing her to make sure her changes will not break the tree when she
finally commits them.  The default setup, however, is to build
a repository tree, usually trunk, or a release branch or tag.</p>

<p>BuildBot uses two terms, <b>buildmaster</b> and <b>buildslave</b>,
that mean exactly what you think they do.  There is typically one
buildmaster, and multiple buildslaves.  Most people will want to read
about <a href="#buildslave">buildslave configuration</a>, which tells
how to set up a buildslave client.  Buildmaster setup is covered <a
href="#buildmaster">here</a>, but is probably of interest only to the
CollabNet administrators who run the buildmaster server.</p>

<h2>Buildslave</h2>

<ol>

<li><p>Install all the dependencies required to build Subversion from
       working copy source.  That's outside the scope of this
       document, but see <a
       href="http://svn.collab.net/repos/svn/trunk/INSTALL"
       >http://svn.collab.net/repos/svn/trunk/INSTALL</a> for
       details.</p>
</li>

<li><p>Create a user <b>buildslave</b> on your system.  The buildslave
       client will use this user, instead of your regular development
       user.  This is partly for security reasons, but also because
       part of the point of the build farm is to make sure things work
       in a relatively untweaked environment.</p>
</li>

<li><p>Create a directory in ~buildslave/ to be the base directory for
       Subversion builds, hereinafter known as the "BASEDIR".  For
       example, ~buildslave/subversion-builds/.  The buildslave will
       touch nothing outside this directory.</p> </li>

<li><p>Write a script that checks out a copy of trunk (or whatever
       branch or tag you want to build), runs configure, make,
       make&nbsp;check, make&nbsp;davcheck, make&nbsp;svncheck, etc.
       Make sure the build works without manual intervention.
       Otherwise, it will not work when BuildBot attempts to do it
       automatically.</p>

    <p>We recommend having that script live in BASEDIR, and having it
       check out the working copy such that it creates a new
       subdirectory within BASEDIR.</p>

    <p class="todo">As rooneg pointed out, we should just advise
       people to use <a
       href="http://svn.collab.net/repos/svn/trunk/tools/test-scripts/svntest"
       >http://svn.collab.net/repos/svn/trunk/tools/test-scripts/svntest</a>
       instead.  But first, need to make sure that works... it may
       need some modifications to cooperate with the build farm
       system, as opposed to the breakage list.</p>
</li>

<li><p>Obtain your slavename and password from the central
       administrator.</p>

    <p class="todo">Document exactly who to contact and how.</p>
</li>

<li><p>Initialize the buildslave (the BuildBot docs call this
       "creating" the buildslave):</p>

    <pre>   buildbot slave BASEDIR MASTERHOST:PORT SLAVENAME PASSWORD</pre>
</li>

<li><p>Fill in your "hostinfo files", so other people can see the
       environment your builds run in, and can contact you if something
       appears to be wrong.  <b>BASEDIR/info/admin</b> should contain
       your name and email address.  This will be visible from the
       build status page; you can munge it to protect from spam
       address harvesters.  <b>BASEDIR/info/host</b> should contain a
       description of the host: OS, version, memory size, CPU speed,
       versions of relevant libraries installed, and the version of
       the buildbot code which is running the buildslave.</p>

    <p class="todo">Give examples of these files.</p>

    <p>If you run many buildslaves, you may want to create a single
       ~buildslave/info file and share it among all the buildslaves
       with symlinks.</p>

<p>BuildBot uses the usual Python installation mechanism, and depends
on the TwistedMatrix library.  If you happen to use Debian GNU/Linux,
you can set these up very easily:</p>

<pre>
   # apt-get update
   # apt-get install&nbsp;python2.3-dev
   # apt-get install&nbsp;twisted
</pre>

<p>Just follow the instructions at <a
