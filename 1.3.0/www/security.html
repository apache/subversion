<h2>Subversion Security</h2>

<p>If you discover a security vulnerability in Subversion, please
email:</p>

<!-- See http://www.cdt.org/speech/spam/030319spamreport.shtml for
     evidence that this has some effect. -->
<blockquote>
<p><strong>&#115;<span>&#101;&#099;&#117;</span>&#114;&#105;&#116;<span>&#121;&#064;&#115;&#117;&#098;&#118;&#101;</span>&#114;&#115;&#105;&#111;<span>&#110;</span>&#046;&#116;&#105;&#103;&#114;&#105;&#115;&#046;&#111;&#114;&#103;</strong></p>

<p>It is safe to send sensitive reports to this address.  List
membership is controlled, and the archives are not publicly
accessible.  We will analyze your report and take appropriate action.
Our usual procedure is to</p>

<ol>
   <li>Make a fix for the vulnerability.</li>

   <li>Discreetly distribute the fix to a few large sites that run
   Subversion servers and are trusted to be discreet themselves.</li>

   <li>Release a new version of Subversion (containing just that fix)
   and publicly announce the vulnerability on the same day.</li>
</ol>

<p>This procedure may vary depending on the nature of the
vulnerability and the degree of pre-existing public awareness, of
course.</p>

<p><span style="color: red"><i>Please do not reproduce the above email
address on other web pages or in public postings.</i></span> Due to
the need for responsiveness, the security list is unmoderated, which
makes it particularly vulnerably to spammers.  Furthermore, we cannot
easily change its address, even if the list were to start receiving
spam, because it's too important to have a consistent, dependable
place to report security holes.</p>

<p>On this page, the address has been encoded in various ways to
reduce the likelihood of a spam harvester noticing it.  But if the
address starts appearing in other places on the Internet, then the
harvesters will inevitably pick it up, and we'll be stuck wading
through ever-increasing amounts of spam, trying not to lose important
vulnerability reports in the noise.</p>
