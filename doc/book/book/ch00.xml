    <para>In the world of open-source software, the Concurrent
      Versions System (CVS) has long been the tool of choice for
      version control.  And rightly so.  CVS itself is free software,
      and its non-restrictive <foreignphrase>modus
      operandi</foreignphrase> and support for networked
      operation&mdash;which allow dozens of geographically dispersed
      programmers to share their work&mdash;fits the collaborative
      nature of the open-source world very well.  CVS and its
      semi-chaotic development model have become cornerstones of
      open-source culture.
    </para>

    <para>But like many tools, CVS is starting to show its age.
      Subversion is a relatively new version control system designed
      to be the successor to CVS.  The designers set out to win the
      hearts of CVS users in two ways: by creating an open-source
      system with a design (and <quote>look and feel</quote>) similar
      to CVS, and by attempting to fix most of CVS's noticeable flaws.
      While the result isn't necessarily the next great evolution in
      version control design, Subversion <emphasis>is</emphasis> very
      powerful, very usable, and very flexible.
    </para>

    <para>This book is written to document the 1.1 series of the
      Subversion version control system.  We have made every attempt to be
      thorough in our coverage.  However, Subversion has a thriving
      and energetic development community, so there are already a
      number of features and improvements planned for future versions
      of Subversion that may change some of the commands and specific
      notes in this book.

    <title>Audience</title>
    
    <para>This book is written for computer-literate folk who want to
      use Subversion to manage their data.  While Subversion runs on a
      number of different operating systems, its primary user
      interface is command-line based.  It is that command-line tool
      (<command>svn</command>) which is discussed and used in this
      book.  For consistency, the examples in this book assume the
      reader is using a Unix-like operating system, and is relatively
      comfortable with Unix and command-line interfaces.</para>

    <para>That said, the <command>svn</command> program also runs on
      non-Unix platforms like Microsoft Windows.  With a few minor
      exceptions, such as the use of backward slashes
      (<literal>\</literal>) instead of forward slashes
      (<literal>/</literal>) for path separators, the input to and
      output from this tool when run on Windows are identical to its
      Unix counterpart.  However, Windows users may find more success
      by running the examples inside the Cygwin Unix emulation
      environment.</para>

    <para>Most readers are probably programmers or sysadmins who need
      to track changes to source code.  This is the most common use
      for Subversion, and therefore it is the scenario underlying all
      of the book's examples.  But Subversion can be used to manage
      changes to any sort of information: images, music, databases,
      documentation, and so on.  To Subversion, all data is just
      data.</para>
    
    <para>While this book is written with the assumption that the
      reader has never used version control, we've also tried to make
      it easy for users of CVS to make a painless leap into
      Subversion.  Special sidebars may discuss CVS from time to time,
      and a special appendix summarizes most of the differences
      between CVS and Subversion.</para>

    <title>How to Read this Book</title>

    <para>This book aims to be useful to people of widely different
      backgrounds&mdash;from people with no previous experience in
      version control to experienced sysadmins.  Depending on your own
      background, certain chapters may be more or less important to
      you.  The following can be considered a <quote>recommended
      reading list</quote> for various types of readers:</para>

    <variablelist>
      <varlistentry>
        <term>Experienced sysadmins</term>
        <listitem>
          <para>The assumption here is that you've probably used CVS
            before, and are dying to get a Subversion server up and
            running ASAP.  Chapters 5 and 6 will show you how to create
            your first repository and make it available over the
            network.  After that's done, chapter 3 and appendix A are
            the fastest routes to learning the Subversion client while
            drawing on your CVS experience.</para>
        </listitem>
      </varlistentry>

      <varlistentry>
        <term>New users</term>
        <listitem>
          <para>Your administrator has probably set up Subversion
            already, and you need to learn how to use the client.  If
            you've never used a version control system (like CVS),
            then chapters 2 and 3 are a vital introduction.  If you're
            already an old hand at CVS, chapter 3 and appendix A are
            the best place to start.</para>
        </listitem>
      </varlistentry>

      <varlistentry>
        <term>Advanced users</term>
        <listitem>
          <para>Whether you're a user or administrator, eventually
            your project will grow larger.  You're going to want to
            learn how to do more advanced things with Subversion, such
            as how to use branches and perform merges (chapter 4),
            how to use Subversion's property support, how to configure
            runtime options (chapter 7), and other things.  Chapters 4
            and 7 aren't vital at first, but be sure to read them once
            you're comfortable with the basics.</para>
        </listitem>
      </varlistentry>

      <varlistentry>
        <term>Developers</term>
        <listitem>
          <para>Presumably, you're already familiar with Subversion,
            and now want to either extend it or build new software on
            top of its many APIs.  Chapter 8 is just for you.</para>
        </listitem>
      </varlistentry>
    </variablelist>

    <para>The book ends with reference material&mdash;chapter 9 is a
      reference guide for all Subversion commands, and the appendices
      cover a number of useful topics.  These are the chapters you're
      mostly likely to come back to after you've finished the
      book.</para>
