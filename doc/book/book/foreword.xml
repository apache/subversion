    <para>A bad Frequently Asked Questions (FAQ) sheet is one that is
      composed not of the questions people actually asked, but of the
      questions the FAQ's author <emphasis>wished</emphasis> people
      had asked.  Perhaps you've seen the type before:</para>

    <blockquote>
      <para>Q: How can I use Glorbosoft XYZ to maximize team
        productivity?</para>
    </blockquote>

    <blockquote>
      <para>A: Many of our customers want to know how they can
        maximize productivity through our patented office groupware
        innovations.  The answer is simple: first, click on the
        <quote><literal>File</literal></quote> menu, scroll down to
        <quote><literal>Increase&nbsp;Productivity</literal></quote>,
        then&hellip;</para>
    </blockquote>

    <para>The problem with such FAQs is that they are not, in a
      literal sense, FAQs at all.  No one ever called the tech support
      line and asked, <quote>How can we maximize
      productivity?</quote>.  Rather, people asked highly specific
      questions, like, <quote>How can we change the calendaring system
      to send reminders two days in advance instead of one?</quote>
      and so on.  But it's a lot easier to make up imaginary
      Frequently Asked Questions than it is to discover the real ones.
      Compiling a true FAQ sheet requires a sustained, organized
      effort: over the lifetime of the software, incoming questions
      must be tracked, responses monitored, and all gathered into a
      coherent, searchable whole that reflects the collective
      experience of users in the wild.  It calls for the patient,
      observant attitude of a field naturalist.  No grand
      hypothesizing, no visionary pronouncements here&mdash;open eyes
      and accurate note-taking are what's needed most.</para>

    <para>What I love about this book is that it grew out of just such
      a process, and shows it on every page.  It is the direct result
      of the authors' encounters with users.  It began with Ben
      Collins-Sussman's observation that people were asking the same
      basic questions over and over on the Subversion mailing lists:
      What are the standard workflows to use with Subversion?  Do
      branches and tags work the same way as in other version control
      systems?  How can I find out who made a particular change?</para>

    <para>Frustrated at seeing the same questions day after day, Ben
      worked intensely over a month in the summer of 2002 to write
      <citetitle>The Subversion Handbook</citetitle>, a sixty page
      manual that covered all the basics of using Subversion.  The
      manual made no pretense of being complete, but it was
      distributed with Subversion and got users over that initial hump
      in the learning curve.  When O'Reilly and Associates decided to
      publish a full-length Subversion book, the path of least
      resistance was obvious: just expand the Subversion
      handbook.</para>

    <para>The three co-authors of the new book were thus presented
      with an unusual opportunity.  Officially, their task was to
      write a book top-down, starting from a table of contents and an
      initial draft.  But they also had access to a steady
      stream&mdash;indeed, an uncontrollable geyser&mdash;of bottom-up
      source material.  Subversion was already in the hands of
      thousands of early adopters, and those users were giving tons of
      feedback, not only about Subversion, but about its existing
      documentation.</para>

    <para>During the entire time they wrote this book, Ben, Mike, and
      Brian haunted the Subversion mailing lists and chat rooms
      incessantly, carefully noting the problems users were having in
      real-life situations.  Monitoring such feedback is part of their
      job descriptions at CollabNet anyway, and it gave them a huge
      advantage when they set out to document Subversion.  The book
      they produced is grounded firmly in the bedrock of experience,
      not in the shifting sands of wishful thinking; it combines the
      best aspects of user manual and FAQ sheet.  This duality might
      not be noticeable on a first reading.  Taken in order, front to
      back, the book is simply a straightforward description of a
      piece of software.  There's the overview, the obligatory guided
      tour, the chapter on administrative configuration, some advanced
      topics, and of course a command reference and troubleshooting
      guide.  Only when you come back to it later, seeking the
      solution to some specific problem, does its authenticity shine
      out: the telling details that can only result from encounters
      with the unexpected, the examples honed from genuine use cases,
      and most of all the sensitivity to the user's needs and the
      user's point of view.</para>

    <para>Of course, no one can promise that this book will answer
      every question you have about Subversion.  Sometimes, the
      precision with which it anticipates your questions will seem
      eerily telepathic; yet occasionally, you will stumble into a
      hole in the community's knowledge, and come away empty-handed.
      When this happens, the best thing you can do is email
      <email>users@subversion.tigris.org</email> and present your
      problem.  The authors are still there, still watching, and they
      include not just the three listed on the cover, but many others
      who contributed corrections and original material.  From the
      community's point of view, solving your problem is merely a
      pleasant side effect of a much larger project&mdash;namely,
      slowly adjusting this book, and ultimately Subversion itself, to
      more closely match the way people actually use it.  They are
      eager to hear from you not merely because they can help you, but
      because you can help them.  With Subversion as with all active
      free software projects, <emphasis>you are not
      alone</emphasis>.</para>
