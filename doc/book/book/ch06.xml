    <para>When you first run the <command>svn</command> command-line
      client, it creates a per-user <firstterm>configuration
      area</firstterm>.  On Unix-like systems, a
      <filename>.subversion/</filename> directory is created in the
      user's home directory.  On Win32 systems, a
      <filename>Subversion</filename> folder is created wherever its
      appropriate to do so (typically somewhere within
      <filename>Documents and Settings\username</filename>, although
      it depends on the system.)</para>

      <para>At the time of writing, the configuration area only
        contains one item: a <filename>proxies</filename> file.  By
        setting values in this file, your Subversion client can
        operate through an http proxy.  (Read the file itself for
        details; it should be self-documenting.)</para><!-- ###TODO

        formats, and so on.  </para> <!-- ###TODO This is already

      <title>Multiple config areas</title>
      
      <para>On Unix, an administrator can create <quote>global</quote>
        Subversion preferences by creating and populating an
        <filename>/etc/subversion/</filename> area.  The per-user
        <filename>~/.subversion/</filename> configuration will still
        override these defaults, however.</para>

      <para>On Win32, an administrator has the option of creating
        three other locations: a global
        <filename>Subversion</filename> folder in the <quote>All
        Users</quote> area, a collection of global registry settings,
        or a collection of per-user registry settings.  The registry
        settings are set in:</para>

HKCU\Software\Tigris.org\Subversion\Proxies
HKCU\Software\Tigris.org\Subversion\Config
etc.
      </screen>

      <para>To clarify, here is the order Subversion searches for
        run-time settings on Win32.  Each subsequent location
        overrides the previous one:</para>

    outline. This pull from the handbook doesn't really follow that,
    so we need to decide what to do here.
    
         1. General use (pset, pget, plist, pdel, pedit)
         2. EOL translation

    <para>Subversion allows you to attach arbitrary
      <quote>metadata</quote> to files and directories.  We refer to
      this data as <firstterm>properties</firstterm>, and they can be
      thought of as collections of name/value pairs (hash-tables)
      attached to each item in your working copy.</para>
  
    <para>To set or get a property on a file or directory, use the
      <command>svn propset</command> and <command>svn
      propget</command> commands.  To list all properties attached to
      an item, use <command>svn proplist</command>.  To delete a
      property, use <command>svn propdel</command>.</para>

    <screen>
$ svn propset color green foo.c
property `color' set on 'foo.c'

$ svn propget color foo.c
green

$ svn propset height "5 feet" foo.c
property `height' set on 'foo.c'

 svn proplist foo.c
Properties on 'foo.c':
  height
  color

$ svn proplist foo.c --verbose
Properties on 'foo.c':
  height : 5 feet
  color : green

$ svn propdel color foo.c
property `color' deleted from 'foo.c'
    </screen>

    <para>Properties are <emphasis>versioned</emphasis>, just like
      file contents.  This means that new properties can be merged
      into your working files, and can sometimes come into conflict
      too.  Property values need not be text, either.  For example,
      you could attach a binary property-value by using the
      <option>-F</option> switch:</para>

<screen>
$ svn propset x-face -F joeface.jpg foo.c
property `x-face' set on 'foo.c'
</screen>

    <para>Subversion also provides a great convenience method for
      editing existing properties: <command>svn
      propedit</command>. When you invoke it, Subversion will open the
      value of the property in question in your favorite editor (or at
      least the editor that you've defined as
      <command>$EDITOR</command> in your shell), and you can edit the
      value just as you would edit any text file. This is
      exceptionally convenient for properties that are a
      newline-separated array of values. (More about this
      later).</para>

    <para>Property changes are still considered <quote>local
      modifications</quote>, and aren't permanent until you commit.
      Like textual changes, property changes can be seen by
      <command>svn diff</command>, <command>svn status</command>, and
      reverted altogether with <command>svn revert</command>:</para>

    <screen>
$ svn diff
Property changes on: foo.c
___________________________________________________________________
Name: color
   + green

$ svn status
_M   foo.c
    </screen>

    <para>Notice that a 2nd column has appeared in the status output;
      the leading underscore indicates that you've not made any
      textual changes, but the <literal>M</literal> means you've
      modified the properties.  <command>svn status</command> tries to
      hide the 2nd <quote>property</quote> column when an item has no
      properties at all; this was a design choice, to ease new users
      into the concept.  When properties are created, edited, or
      updated on an item, that 2nd column appears forever
      after.</para>

    <para>Also: don't worry about the non-standard way that Subversion
      currently displays property differences.  You can still run
      <command>svn diff</command> and redirect the output to create a
      usable patch file.  The <command>patch</command> program will
      ignore property patches; as a rule, it ignores any noise it
      can't understand.  (In future versions of Subversion, though, we
      may start using a new patch format that describes property
      changes and file copies/renames.)</para><!-- ###TODO Do we want

    <sect2 id="svn-ch-6-sect-2.1">
      
     <title>Special properties</title>

      <para>Subversion has no particular policy regarding properties;
        they can be used for any purpose.  The only restriction is
        that Subversion has reserved the <literal>svn:</literal> name
        prefix for itself.  A number of special <quote>magic</quote>
        properties begin with this prefix.  We'll cover these features
        here.</para>
      
      <sect3 id="svn-ch-6-sect-2.1.1">
        <title><literal>svn:executable</literal></title>
        
        <para>This is a file-only property, and can be set to any
          value.  Its mere existence causes a file's permissions to be
          executable.</para>

      </sect3>

      <sect3 id="svn-ch-6-sect-2.1.2">
        <title><literal>svn:mime-type</literal></title>
        
        <para>At the present time, Subversion examines the
          <literal>svn:mime-type</literal> property to decide if a
          file is text or binary.  If the file has no
          <literal>svn:mime-type</literal> property, or if the
          property's value matches <literal>text/*</literal>, then
          Subversion assumes it is a text file.  If the file has the
          <literal>svn:mime-type</literal> property set to anything
          other than <literal>text/*</literal>, it assumes the file is
          binary.</para>

        <para>If Subversion believes that the file is binary, it will
          not attempt to perform contextual merges during updates.
          Instead, Subversion creates two files side-by-side in your
          working copy; the one containing your local modifications is
          renamed with a <filename>.orig</filename> extension.</para>

        <para>Subversion also helps users by running a
          binary-detection algorithm in the <command>svn
          import</command> and <command>svn add</command> subcommands.
          These subcommands try to make a good guess at a file's
          binary-ness, and then (possibly) set a
          <literal>svn:mime-type</literal> property of
          <literal>application/octet-stream</literal> on the file
          being added.  (If Subversion guesses wrong, you can always
          remove or hand-edit the property.)</para>

        <para>Finally, if the <literal>svn:mime-type</literal>
          property is set, then mod_dav_svn will use it to fill in the
          <literal>Content-type:</literal> header when responding to
          an http GET request.  This makes files display more nicely
          when perusing a repository with a web browser.</para>

      </sect3>

      <sect3 id="svn-ch-6-sect-2.1.3">
        <title><literal>svn:ignore</literal></title>

        <para>If you attach this property to a directory, it causes
          certain file patterns within the directory to be ignored by
          <command>svn status</command>.  For example, suppose I don't
          want to see object files or backup files in my status
          listing:</para>

        <screen>
$ svn status
M  ./foo.c
?  ./foo.o
?  ./foo.c~
        </screen>

        <para>Using <command>svn propedit</command>, I would set the
          value of <literal>svn:ignore</literal> to a
          newline-delimited list of patterns:</para>

        <screen>
$ svn propget svn:ignore .

        <title><literal>svn:keywords</literal></title>

        <para>Subversion has the ability to substitute useful strings
          into special <firstterm>keywords</firstterm> within text
          files.  For example, if I placed this text into a
          file:</para>

          date in which this file last changed.  The keyword string is
          not removed in the replacement, just the specific
          information is placed after the keyword string:</para>

        <title><literal>svn:eol-style</literal></title>

        <para>By default, Subversion doesn't pay any attention to line
          endings.  If a text file has either LF, CR, or CRLF endings,
          then those are the line endings that will exist on the file
          in both the repository and working copy.</para>
        
        <para>But if developers are working on different platforms,
          line endings can sometimes become troublesome.  For example,
          if a Win32 developer and Unix developer took turns modifying
          a file, its line endings might flip-flop back and forth from
          revision to revision in the repository.  This makes
          examining or merging differences very difficult, as
          <emphasis>every</emphasis> line appears to be changed in
          each version of the file.</para>

        <para>The solution here is to set the
          <literal>svn:eol-style</literal> property to ``native''.
          This makes the file always appear with the
          <quote>native</quote> line endings of each developer's
          operating system.  Note, however, that the file will always
          contain LF endings in the repository.  This prevents the
          line-ending <quote>churn</quote> from revision to
          revision.</para>

        <para>Alternately, you can force files to always retain a
          fixed, specific line ending: set a file's
          <literal>svn:eol-style</literal> property to one of
          <literal>LF</literal>, <literal>CR</literal> or
          <literal>CRLF</literal>.  A Win32 <filename>.dsp</filename>
          file, for example, which is used by Microsoft development
          tools, should always have CRLF endings.</para>

    <title>Modules</title>
    
    <para>Sometimes it's useful to construct a working copy that is
      made out of a number of different checkouts.  For example, you
      may want different sub-directories to come from different
      locations in a repository.</para>

    <para>On the one hand, you could begin by checking out a working
      copy, and then run <command>svn switch</command> on various
      subdirectories.  But this is a bit of work.  Wouldn't it be nice
      to define&mdash;in a single place&mdash;exactly how you want the
      final working copy to be?</para>

    <para>This is known as a <firstterm>module</firstterm>.  You can
      define a module by attaching another special
      <quote>magic</quote> <literal>svn:</literal> property to a
      directory: the <literal>svn:externals</literal> property.</para>

    <para>The value of this property is a list of subdirectories and
      their corresponding URLs:</para>

    <screen>
$ svn propget svn:externals projectdir

subdir1/bar       http://blah.blah.blah/repositories/theirproj
subdir1/bar/baz   http://blorg.blorg.blorg/basement/code
    </screen>

    <para>Assuming that this property is attached to the directory
      <filename>projectdir</filename>, then when we check it out,
      we'll get everything else defined by the property.</para>

$ svn checkout http://foo.com/repos/projectdir
A  projectdir/blah.c
A  projectdir/gloo.c
A  projectdir/trout.h

A  projectdir/subdir1/foo/rho.txt
A  projectdir/subdir1/foo/pi.txt
A  projectdir/subdir1/foo/tau.doc
Checked out revision 128.
&hellip;
    </screen>

    <para>By tweaking the value of the
      <literal>svn:externals</literal> property, the definition of the
      module can change over time, and subsequent calls to
      <command>svn update</command> will update working copies
      appropriately.</para>

    <!-- ###TODO Anything else to add here?  I'm suspicious that this
    feature doesn't work as I expect just yet; when I run 'svn up' at the
    top of the wc, nothing happens in the external directory at all,
