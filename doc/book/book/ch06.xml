    <para>When you first run the <command>svn</command> command-line
      client, it creates a per-user <firstterm>configuration
      area</firstterm>.  On Unix-like systems, a
      <filename>.subversion/</filename> directory is created in the
      user's home directory.  On Win32 systems, a
      <filename>Subversion</filename> folder is created wherever its
      appropriate to do so (typically somewhere within
      <filename>Documents and Settings\username</filename>, although
      it depends on the system.)</para>

      <para>At the time of writing, the configuration area only
        contains one item: a <filename>proxies</filename> file.  By
        setting values in this file, your Subversion client can
        operate through an http proxy.  (Read the file itself for
        details; it should be self-documenting.)</para><!-- ###TODO

      <para>On Unix, an administrator can create <quote>global</quote>
        Subversion preferences by creating and populating an
        <filename>/etc/subversion/</filename> area.  The per-user
        <filename>~/.subversion/</filename> configuration will still
        override these defaults, however.</para>

      <para>On Win32, an administrator has the option of creating
        three other locations: a global
        <filename>Subversion</filename> folder in the <quote>All
        Users</quote> area, a collection of global registry settings,
        or a collection of per-user registry settings.  The registry
        settings are set in:</para>

HKCU\Software\Tigris.org\Subversion\Proxies
HKCU\Software\Tigris.org\Subversion\Config

      <para>To clarify, here is the order Subversion searches for
        run-time settings on Win32.  Each subsequent location

    <para>Subversion allows you to attach arbitrary
      <quote>metadata</quote> to files and directories.  We refer to
      this data as <firstterm>properties</firstterm>, and they can be
      thought of as collections of name/value pairs (hash-tables)
      attached to each item in your working copy.</para>
  
    <para>To set or get a property on a file or directory, use the
      <command>svn propset</command> and <command>svn
      propget</command> commands.  To list all properties attached to
      an item, use <command>svn proplist</command>.  To delete a
      property, use <command>svn propdel</command>.</para>

    <screen>
$ svn propset color green foo.c
property `color' set on 'foo.c'

$ svn propget color foo.c
green

$ svn propset height "5 feet" foo.c
property `height' set on 'foo.c'

 svn proplist foo.c
Properties on 'foo.c':
  height
  color

$ svn proplist foo.c --verbose
Properties on 'foo.c':
  height : 5 feet
  color : green

$ svn propdel color foo.c
property `color' deleted from 'foo.c'
    </screen>

    <para>Properties are <emphasis>versioned</emphasis>, just like
      file contents.  This means that new properties can be merged
      into your working files, and can sometimes come into conflict
      too.  Property values need not be text, either.  For example,
      you could attach a binary property-value by using the
      <option>-F</option> switch:</para>

<screen>
$ svn propset x-face -F joeface.jpg foo.c
property `x-face' set on 'foo.c'
</screen>

    <para>Subversion also provides a great convenience method for
      editing existing properties: <command>svn
      propedit</command>. When you invoke it, Subversion will open the
      value of the property in question in your favorite editor (or at
      least the editor that you've defined as
      <command>$EDITOR</command> in your shell), and you can edit the
      value just as you would edit any text file. This is
      exceptionally convenient for properties that are a
      newline-separated array of values. (More about this
      later).</para>

    <para>Property changes are still considered <quote>local
      modifications</quote>, and aren't permanent until you commit.
      Like textual changes, property changes can be seen by
      <command>svn diff</command>, <command>svn status</command>, and
      reverted altogether with <command>svn revert</command>:</para>

    <screen>
$ svn diff
Property changes on: foo.c
___________________________________________________________________
Name: color
   + green

$ svn status
_M   foo.c
    </screen>

    <para>Notice that a 2nd column has appeared in the status output;
      the leading underscore indicates that you've not made any
      textual changes, but the <literal>M</literal> means you've
      modified the properties.  <command>svn status</command> tries to
      hide the 2nd <quote>property</quote> column when an item has no
      properties at all; this was a design choice, to ease new users
      into the concept.  When properties are created, edited, or
      updated on an item, that 2nd column appears forever
      after.</para>

    <para>Also: don't worry about the non-standard way that Subversion
      currently displays property differences.  You can still run
      <command>svn diff</command> and redirect the output to create a
      usable patch file.  The <command>patch</command> program will
      ignore property patches; as a rule, it ignores any noise it
      can't understand.  (In future versions of Subversion, though, we
      may start using a new patch format that describes property
      changes and file copies/renames.)</para><!-- ###TODO Do we want

    <sect2 id="svn-ch-6-sect-2.1">
      
     <title>Special properties</title>

      <para>Subversion has no particular policy regarding properties;
        they can be used for any purpose.  The only restriction is
        that Subversion has reserved the <literal>svn:</literal> name
        prefix for itself.  A number of special <quote>magic</quote>
        properties begin with this prefix.  We'll cover these features
        here.</para>
      
      <sect3 id="svn-ch-6-sect-2.1.1">
        <title><literal>svn:executable</literal></title>
        
        <para>This is a file-only property, and can be set to any
          value.  Its mere existence causes a file's permissions to be
          executable.</para>

      </sect3>

      <sect3 id="svn-ch-6-sect-2.1.2">
        <title><literal>svn:mime-type</literal></title>
        
        <para>At the present time, Subversion examines the
          <literal>svn:mime-type</literal> property to decide if a
          file is text or binary.  If the file has no
          <literal>svn:mime-type</literal> property, or if the
          property's value matches <literal>text/*</literal>, then
          Subversion assumes it is a text file.  If the file has the
          <literal>svn:mime-type</literal> property set to anything
          other than <literal>text/*</literal>, it assumes the file is
          binary.</para>

        <para>If Subversion believes that the file is binary, it will
          not attempt to perform contextual merges during updates.
          Instead, Subversion creates two files side-by-side in your
          working copy; the one containing your local modifications is
          renamed with a <filename>.orig</filename> extension.</para>

        <para>Subversion also helps users by running a
          binary-detection algorithm in the <command>svn
          import</command> and <command>svn add</command> subcommands.
          These subcommands try to make a good guess at a file's
          binary-ness, and then (possibly) set a
          <literal>svn:mime-type</literal> property of
          <literal>application/octet-stream</literal> on the file
          being added.  (If Subversion guesses wrong, you can always
          remove or hand-edit the property.)</para>

        <para>Finally, if the <literal>svn:mime-type</literal>
          property is set, then mod_dav_svn will use it to fill in the
          <literal>Content-type:</literal> header when responding to
          an http GET request.  This makes files display more nicely
          when perusing a repository with a web browser.</para>

      </sect3>

      <sect3 id="svn-ch-6-sect-2.1.3">
        <title><literal>svn:ignore</literal></title>

        <para>If you attach this property to a directory, it causes
          certain file patterns within the directory to be ignored by
          <command>svn status</command>.  For example, suppose I don't
          want to see object files or backup files in my status
          listing:</para>

        <screen>
$ svn status
M  ./foo.c
?  ./foo.o
?  ./foo.c~
        </screen>

        <para>Using <command>svn propedit</command>, I would set the
          value of <literal>svn:ignore</literal> to a
          newline-delimited list of patterns:</para>

        <screen>
$ svn propget svn:ignore .

        <title><literal>svn:keywords</literal></title>

        <para>Subversion has the ability to substitute useful strings
          into special <firstterm>keywords</firstterm> within text
          files.  For example, if I placed this text into a
          file:</para>

        <title><literal>svn:eol-style</literal></title>

        <para>By default, Subversion doesn't pay any attention to line
          endings.  If a text file has either LF, CR, or CRLF endings,
          then those are the line endings that will exist on the file
          in both the repository and working copy.</para>
        
        <para>But if developers are working on different platforms,
          line endings can sometimes become troublesome.  For example,
          if a Win32 developer and Unix developer took turns modifying
          a file, its line endings might flip-flop back and forth from
          revision to revision in the repository.  This makes
          examining or merging differences very difficult, as
          <emphasis>every</emphasis> line appears to be changed in
          each version of the file.</para>

        <para>The solution here is to set the
          <literal>svn:eol-style</literal> property to ``native''.
          This makes the file always appear with the
          <quote>native</quote> line endings of each developer's
          operating system.  Note, however, that the file will always
          contain LF endings in the repository.  This prevents the
          line-ending <quote>churn</quote> from revision to
          revision.</para>

        <para>Alternately, you can force files to always retain a
          fixed, specific line ending: set a file's
          <literal>svn:eol-style</literal> property to one of
          <literal>LF</literal>, <literal>CR</literal> or
          <literal>CRLF</literal>.  A Win32 <filename>.dsp</filename>
          file, for example, which is used by Microsoft development
          tools, should always have CRLF endings.</para>

    <para>Sometimes it's useful to construct a working copy that is
      made out of a number of different checkouts.  For example, you
      may want different sub-directories to come from different
      locations in a repository.</para>

    <para>On the one hand, you could begin by checking out a working

      to define&mdash;in a single place&mdash;exactly how you want the
      final working copy to be?</para>

    <para>This is known as a <firstterm>module</firstterm>.  You can
      define a module by attaching another special
      <quote>magic</quote> <literal>svn:</literal> property to a

&hellip;
    </screen>

    <para>By tweaking the value of the
      <literal>svn:externals</literal> property, the definition of the
      module can change over time, and subsequent calls to
      <command>svn update</command> will update working copies
      appropriately.</para>

      level directory (we'll use <filename>/vendor</filename>) to hold
      the vendor branches.  Then you import the third party code into
      a subdirectory of <filename>/vendor</filename>, and copy it into
      <filename>/trunk</filename> where you make your local changes.
      With each new release of the code you are tracking you bring it
      into the vendor branch and merge the changes into
      <filename>/trunk</filename>, resolving whatever conflicts occur
      between your local changes and the upstream changes.</para>

    <para>Let's try and make this a bit clearer with an
      example.</para>

    <para>First, the initial import.</para>
    
    <screen>
      $ svn mkdir http://svnhost/repos/vendor/foobar
      $ svn import http://svnhost/repos/vendor/foobar ~/foobar-1.0 current
    </screen>
    
    <para>Now we've got the current version of the foobar project in
      <filename>/vendor/foobar/current</filename>.  We make another
      copy of it so we can always refer to that version, and then copy
      it into the trunk so you can work on it.</para>
    
    <screen>
      $ svn copy http://svnhost/repos/vendor/foobar/current    \
                 http://svnhost/repos/vendor/foobar/foobar-1.0 \
                 -m `tagging foobar-1.0'
      $ svn copy http://svnhost/repos/vendor/foobar/foobar-1.0 \
                 http://svnhost/repos/trunk/foobar             \
                 -m `bringing foobar-1.0 into trunk'
    </screen>

    <para>Now you just check out a copy of
    <filename>/trunk/foobar</filename> and get to work!</para>

    <para>Later on, the developers at FooBar Widgets, Inc release a
      new version of their code, so you want to update the version of
      the code you're using.  First, you check out the
      <filename>/vendor/foobar/current</filename> directory, then copy
      the new release over that working copy, handle any renames,
      additions or removals manually, and then commit.</para>

    <screen>
      $ svn checkout http://svnhost/repos/vendor/foobar/current ~/current
      $ cd ~/foobar-1.1
      $ tar -cf - . | (cd ~/current ; tar -xf -)
      $ cd ~/current
      $ mv foobar.c main.c
      $ svn move main.c foobar.c
      $ svn delete dead.c
      $ svn add doc
      $ svn add doc/*
      $ svn commit -m `importing foobar 1.1 on vendor branch'
    </screen>

    <para>Whoa, that was complicated. Don't worry, most cases are far
      simpler. </para>

    <para>What happened? foobar 1.0 had a file called
      <filename>main.c</filename>.  This file was renamed to
      <filename>foobar.c</filename> in 1.1.  So your working-copy had
      the old <filename>main.c</filename> which Subversion knew about, 
      and the new <filename>foobar.c</filename> which Subversion did 
      not know about.  You rename <filename>foobar.c</filename> to 
      <filename>main.c</filename> and <command>svn mv</command> it 
      back to the new name.  This way, Subversion will know that 
      <filename>foobar.c</filename> is a descendant of 
      <filename>main.c</filename>.  <filename>dead.c</filename> has 
      been removed in 1.1, and they have finally written some 
      documentation, so you add that.</para>

    <para>Next you copy <filename>/vendor/foobar/current</filename> to
      <filename>/vendor/foobar/foobar-1.1</filename> so you can always
      refer back to version 1.1, like this.</para>

    <screen>
      $ svn copy http://svnhost/repos/vendor/foobar/current    \
                 http://svnhost/repos/vendor/foobar/foobar-1.1 \
                 -m `tagging foobar-1.1'
    </screen>

    <para>Now that you have a pristine copy of foobar 1.1 in
      <filename>/vendor</filename>, you just have to merge their
      changes into <filename>/trunk</filename> and you're done.  That
      looks like this.</para>

    <screen>
      $ svn checkout http://svnhost/repos/trunk/foobar ~/foobar
      $ cd ~/foobar
      $ svn merge http://svnhost/repos/vendor/foobar/foobar-1.0 \
                  http://svnhost/repos/vendor/foobar/foobar-1.1
      $
      &hellip; # resolve all the conflicts between their changes and your changes
      $ svn commit -m `merging foobar 1.1 into trunk'
    </screen>
    
    <para>There, you're done.  You now have a copy of foobar 1.1 with
      all your local changes merged into it in your tree.</para>

    <para>Vendor branches that have more than several deletes,
      additions and moves can use the
      <command>svn_load_dirs.pl</command> script that comes with the
      Subversion distribution.  This script automates the above
      importing steps to make sure that mistakes are minimized.  You
      still need to use the merge commands to merge the new versions
      of foobar into your own local copy containing your local
      modifications.</para>

    <para>This script has the following enhancements over <command>svn
    import</command>:</para>

    <itemizedlist>
      <listitem>
        <para>Can be run at any point in time to bring an existing
          directory in the repository to exactly match an external
          directory.  This script runs all the <command>svn
          add</command>, <command>svn rm</command> and optionally any
          <command>svn mv</command> commands as necessary.</para>
      </listitem>

      <listitem>
        <para>Optionally tag the newly imported directory.</para>
      </listitem>

      <listitem>
        <para>Optionally add arbitrary properties to files and
          directories that match a regular expression.</para>
      </listitem>

    </itemizedlist>

    <para>This script takes care of complications where Subversion
      requires a commit before renaming a file or directory twice,
      such as if you had a vendor branch that renamed
      <filename>foobar-1.1/docs/doc.ps</filename> to
      <filename>foobar-1.2/documents/doc-1.2.ps</filename>.  Here, you
      would rename <filename>docs</filename> to
      <filename>documents</filename>, perform a commit, then rename
      <filename>doc.ps</filename> to <filename>doc-1.2.ps</filename>.
      You could not do the two renames without the commit, because
      <filename>doc.ps</filename> was already moved once from
      <filename>docs/doc.ps</filename> to
      <filename>documents/doc.ps</filename>.</para>

    <para>This script always compares the directory being imported to
      what currently exists in the Subversion repository and takes the
      necessary steps to add, delete and rename files and directories
      to make the subversion repository match the imported directory.
      As such, it can be used on an empty subversion directory for the
      first import or for any following imports to upgrade a vendor
      branch.</para>

    <para>For the first foobar-1.0 release located in
      <filename>~/foobar-1.0</filename>:</para>

    <screen>
      $ svn_load_dirs.pl -t foobar-1.0                      \
                         http://svnhost/repos/vendor/foobar \
                         current                            \
                         ~/foobar-1.0
    </screen>

    <para><command>svn_load_dirs.pl</command> takes three mandatory
      arguments.  The first argument, <systemitem
      class="url">http://svnhost/repos/vendor/foobar</systemitem>, is
      the URL to the base Subversion directory to work in.  In this
      case, we're working in the <filename>vendor/foobar</filename>
      part of the Subversion repository.  The next argument,
      <filename>current</filename>, is relative to the first and is
      the directory where the current import will take place, in this
      case <systemitem
      class="url">http://svnhost/repos/vendor/foobar/current</systemitem>.
      The last argument, <filename>~/foobar-1.0</filename>, is the
      directory to import.  Finally, the optional
      <option>-t</option> command line option is also relative
      to <systemitem
      class="url">http://svnhost/repos/vendor/foobar</systemitem> and
      tells <command>svn_load_dirs.pl</command> to create a tag of the
      imported directory in <systemitem
      class="url">http://svnhost/repos/vendor/foobar/foobar-1.0</systemitem>.</para>

    <para>The import of foobar-1.1 would be taken care of in the same
      way:</para>

    <screen>
      $ svn_load_dirs.pl -t foobar-1.1                      \
                         http://svnhost/repos/vendor/foobar \
                         current                            \
                         ~/foobar-1.1
    </screen>

    <para>The script looks in your current <systemitem
      class="url">http://svnhost/repos/vendor/foobar/current</systemitem>
      directory and sees what changes need to take place for it to
      match <filename>~/foobar-1.1</filename>.  The script is kind
      enough to notice that there are files and directories that exist
      in 1.0 and not in 1.1 and asks if you want to perform any
      renames.  At this point, you can indicate that
      <filename>main.c</filename> was renamed to
      <filename>foobar.c</filename> and then indicate that no further
      renames have taken place.</para>

    <para>The script will then delete <filename>dead.c</filename> and
      add <filename>doc</filename> and <filename>doc/*</filename> to
      the Subversion repository and finally create a tag foobar-1.1 in
      <systemitem
      class="url">http://svnhost/repos/vendor/foobar/foobar-1.1</systemitem>.</para>

    <para>The script also accepts a separate configuration file for
      applying properties to specific files and directories matching a
      regular expression that are <emphasis>added</emphasis> to the repository.
      This script will not modify properties of already existing files
      or directories in the repository.  This configuration file is
      specified to <command>svn_load_dirs.pl</command> using the
      <option>-p</option> command line option.  The format of
      the file is either two or four columns.</para>

    <para><literal>regular_expression control property_name
        property_value</literal></para>

    <para>The <literal>regular_expression</literal> is a Perl style
      regular expression.  The <literal>control</literal> column must
      either be set to <literal>break</literal> or
      <command>cont</command>.  It is used to tell
      <command>svn_load_dirs.pl</command> if the following lines in
      the configuration file should be examined for a match or if all
      matching should stop.  If <literal>control</literal> is set to
      <command>break</command>, then no more lines from the
      configuration file will be matched.  If
      <literal>control</literal> is set to <command>cont</command>,
      which is short for continue, then more comparisons will be made.
      Multiple properties can be set for one file or directory this
      way.  The last two columns, <literal>property_name</literal> and
      <literal>property_value</literal> are optional and are applied
      to matching files and directories.</para>

    <para>If you have whitespace in any of the
      <literal>regular_expression</literal>,
      <literal>property_name</literal> or
      <literal>property_value</literal> columns, you must surround the
      value with either a single or double quote.  You can protect
      single or double quotes with a \ character.  The \ character is
      removed by this script <emphasis>only</emphasis> for whitespace or quote
      characters, so you do not need to protect any other characters,
      beyond what you would normally protect for the regular
      expression.</para>

    <para>This sample configuration file was used to load on a Unix
      box a number of Zip files containing Windows files with
      <literal>CRLF</literal> end of lines.</para>

    <screen>
      \.doc$              break   svn:mime-type   application/msword
      \.ds(p|w)$          break   svn:eol-style   CRLF
      \.ilk$              break   svn:eol-style   CRLF
      \.ncb$              break   svn:eol-style   CRLF
      \.opt$              break   svn:eol-style   CRLF
      \.exe$              break   svn:mime-type   application/octet-stream
      dos2unix-eol\.sh$   break
      .*                  break   svn:eol-style   native
    </screen>

    <para>In this example, all the files should be converted to the
      native end of line style, which the last line of the
      configuration handles.  The exception is
      <command>dos2unix-eol.sh</command>, which contains embedded
      <literal>CR</literal>'s used to find and replace Windows
      <literal>CRLF</literal> end of line characters with Unix's
      <literal>LF</literal> characters.  Since <command>svn</command>
      and <command>svn_load_dirs.pl</command> convert all
      <literal>CR</literal>, <literal>CRLF</literal> and
      <literal>LF</literal>'s to the native end of line style when
      <literal>svn:eol-style</literal> is set to
      <literal>native</literal>, this file should be left untouched.
      Hence, the <command>break</command> with no property
      settings.</para>

    <para>The Windows Visual C++ and Visual Studio files
      (<filename>*.dsp</filename>, <filename>*.dsw</filename>, etc.)
      should retain their <literal>CRLF</literal> line endings on any
      operating system and any <filename>*.doc</filename> files are
      always treated as binary files, hence the
      <literal>svn:mime-type</literal> setting of
      <literal>application/msword</literal>.</para>
