    <para>If you've been reading this book chapter by chapter, from
      start to finish, you should by now have acquired enough
      knowledge to use the Subversion client to perform the most
      common version control operations.  You understand how to
      checkout a working copy from a Subversion repository.  You are
      comfortable with submitting and receiving changes using the
      <command>svn commit</command> and <command>svn update</command>
      functions.  You've probably even developed a reflex which causes
      you to run the <command>svn status</command> command almost
      unconsciously.  For all intents and purposes, you are ready to
      use Subversion in a typical environment.</para>

    <para>But the Subversion feature set doesn't stop at "common
      version control operations".</para>

    <para>This chapter highlights some of Subversion's features which
      aren't quite so regularly used.  In it, we will discuss
      Subversion's property (or <quote>metadata</quote>) support, and
      how to modify Subversion's default behaviors by tweaking its
      run-time configuration area.  We will describe how you can use
      externals definitions to instruct Subversion to pull data from
      multiple repositories.  We'll cover in detail some of the
      additional client- and server-side tools that are part of the
      Subversion distribution.</para>

    <para>Before reading this chapter, you should be familiar with the
      basic file and directory versioning capabilities of Subversion.
      If you haven't already read about those, or if you need a
      refresher, we recommend that you check out <xref
      linkend="svn-ch-2" /> and <xref linkend="svn-ch-3" />.  Once
      you've mastered the basics and consumed this chapter, you'll be
      a Subversion power-user&mdash;or we'll refund your money!

        <para>This offer applies only to those who, like most folks,
          pay nothing for Subversion.</para>

    <title>Run-time Configuration Area</title>
    
    <para>Subversion provides many optional behaviors that can be
      controlled by the user.  Many of these options are of the kind
      that a user would wish to apply to all Subversion operations.
      So, rather than forcing users to remember command-line arguments
      for specifying these options, and to use them for each and every
      operation they perform, Subversion uses configuration files,
      segregated into a Subversion configuration area.</para>

    <para>The Subversion <firstterm>configuration area</firstterm> is
      a two-tiered hierarchy of option names and their values.
      Usually, this boils down to a special directory which contains
      <firstterm>configuration files</firstterm> (the first tier),
      which are just text files in standard INI format (with
      <quote>sections</quote> providing the second tier).  These files
      can be easily edited using your favorite text editor (such as
      Emacs or vi), and contain directives read by the client to
      determine which of several optional behaviors the user
      prefers.</para>

    <!-- ***************************************************************** -->
    <sect2 id="svn-ch-6-sect-1.1">
      <title>Configuration Area Layout</title>

      <para>The first time that the <command>svn</command>
        command-line client is executed, it creates a per-user
        configuration area.  On Unix-like systems, this area appears
        as a directory named <filename>.subversion</filename> in the
        user's home directory.  On Win32 systems, Subversion creates a
        folder named <filename>Subversion</filename>, typically inside
        the <filename>Application Data</filename> area of the user's
        profile directory.  However, on this platform the exact
        location differs from system to system, and is dictated by the
        Windows registry.  We will refer to the per-user configuration
        area using its Unix name,
        <filename>.subversion</filename>.</para>

      <para>In addition to the per-user configuration area, Subversion
        also recognizes the existence of a system-wide configuration
        area.  The gives system administrators the ability to
        establish defaults for all users on a given machine.  Note
        that the system-wide configuration area does not alone dictate
        mandatory policy&mdash;the settings in the per-user
        configuration area override those in the system-wide one, and
        command-line arguments supplied to <command>svn</command>
        program have the final word on behavior.  On Unix-like
        platforms, the sytem-wide configuration area is expected to be
        the <filename>/etc/subversion</filename> directory; on Windows
        machines, it again looks for a <filename>Subversion</filename>
        directory inside the common Application Data location (again,
        as specified by the Windows Registry).  Unlike the per-user
        case, the <command>svn</command> program does not attempt to
        create the system-wide configuration area.</para>

      <para>The <filename>.subversion</filename> directory currently
        contains three files&mdash;two configuration files
        (<filename>config</filename> and
        <filename>servers</filename>), and a
        <filename>README</filename> file which describes the INI
        format.  At the time of their creation, the files contain
        default values for each of the supported Subversion options,
        mostly commented out and grouped with textual descriptions
        about how the values for the key affect Subversion's behavior.
        To change a certain behavior, you need only to load the
        appropriate configuration file into a text editor, and modify
        the desired option value.  If at any time you wish to have the
        default settings restore to one or more of the configuration
        files, you can simply delete the file, and run some innocuous
        <command>svn</command> command, such as <command>svn
        --version</command>, and the missing file will be recreated in
        its default state.</para>

      <title>Configuration and the Windows Registry</title>

      <para>In addition to the usual INI-based configuration area,
        Subversion clients running on Windows platforms may also use
        the Windows registry to hold the configuration data.  The
        option names and their values are the same as in the INI
        files.  The <quote>file/section</quote> hierarchy is
        preserved as well, though addressed in a slightly different
        fashion&mdash;in this schema, files and sections are just
        levels in the registry key tree.</para>

      <para>Subversion looks for system-wide configuration values
        under the
        <literal>HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\Software\Tigris.org\Subversion</literal>
        key.  For example, the <literal>global-ignores</literal> option,
        which is in the <literal>miscellany</literal> section of the
        <filename>config</filename> file, would be found at
        <literal>HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\Software\Tigris.org\Subversion\Config\Miscellany\global-ignores</literal>.
        Per-user configuration values should be stored under
        <literal>HKEY_CURRENT_USER\Software\Tigris.org\Subversion</literal>.
      </para>

      <para>Registry-based configuration options are parsed
        <emphasis>before</emphasis> their file-based counterparts,
        so are overridden by values found in the configuration
        files.  In other words, configuration priority is granted in
        the following order on a Windows system:</para>
      
      <orderedlist>
        <listitem>
          <para>Command-line options</para>
        </listitem>
        <listitem>
          <para>The per-user INI files</para>
        </listitem>

          <para>The per-user Registry values</para>

        </listitem>
        <listitem>
          <para>The system-wide Registry values</para>
        </listitem>
      </orderedlist>

      <para>Also, the Windows Registry doesn't really support the
        notion of something being <quote>commented out</quote>.
        However, Subversion will ignore any option key whose name
        begins with a hash (<literal>#</literal>) character.  This
        allows you to effectively comment out a Subversion option
        without deleting the entire key from the Registry, obviously
        simplifying the process of restoring that option.</para>

      <para>The <command>svn</command> command-line client never
        attempts to write to the Windows Registry, and will not
        attempt to create a default configuration area there.  You can
        create the keys you need using the <command>REGEDIT</command>
        program.  Alternatively, you can create a
        <filename>.REG</filename> file, and then double-click on that
        file from the Explorer shell, which will cause the data to be
        merged into your registry.</para>

        options are effectively commented out.  You need only to

        <para>When Subversion is used over a network, it attempts to
          match the name of the server it is trying to reach with a
          group name under the <literal>groups</literal> section.  If
          a match is made, Subversion then looks for a section in the
          <filename>servers</filename> file whose name is the matched

          configuration settions.</para>

    <title>Properties</title>

    <para>We've already covered in detail how Subversion stores and
      retrieves various versions of files and directories in its
      repository.  Whole chapters have been devoted to this most
      fundamental piece of functionality provided by the tool.  And
      if the versioning support stopped there, Subversion would still
      be complete from a version control perspective.  But it
      doesn't stop there.</para>

    <para>In addition to versioning your directories and files,
      Subversion provides interfaces for adding, modifying, and
      removing versioned metadata on each of your versioned
      directories and files.  We refer to this metadata as
      <firstterm>properties</firstterm>, and they can be thought of as
      two-column tables that map property names to arbitrary values
      attached to each item in your working copy.  Generally speaking,
      the names and values of the properties can be whatever you want
      them to be, with the constraint that the names must be
      human-readable text.  And the best part about these properties
      is that they, too, are versioned, just like the textual contents
      of your files.  You can modify, commit, and revert property
      changes as easily as committing textual changes.  And you
      receive other people's property changes as you update your
      working copy.</para>

    <sidebar>
      <title>Other Properties in Subversion</title>

      <para>Properties show up elsewhere in Subversion, too.  Just as
        files and directories may have arbitrary property names and
        values attached to them, each revision as a whole may have
        arbitrary properties attached to it.  The same constraints
        apply&mdash;human-readable, text names and anything-you-want,
        binary values&mdash;except that revision properties are not
        versioned.  See <xref linkend="svn-ch-5-sect-1.2" /> for more
        information on these unversioned properties.</para>
    </sidebar>

    <para>In this section, we will examine the utility&mdash;both to
      users of Subversion, and to Subversion itself&mdash;of property
      support.  You'll learn about the property-related
      <command>svn</command> subcommands, and how property
      modifications affect your normal Subversion workflow.
      Hopefully, you'll be convinced that Subversion properties can
      enhance your version control experience.</para>

    <!-- ***************************************************************** -->
    <sect2 id="svn-ch-6-sect-2.1">
      <title>Why Properties?</title>

      <para>Properties can be very useful additions to your working
        copy.  In fact, Subversion itself uses properties to house
        special information, and as a way to denote that certain
        special processing might be needed.  Likewise, you can use
        properties for your own purposes.  Of course, anything you can
        do with properties you could also do using regular versioned
        files, but consider the following example of Subversion
        property use.</para>

      <para>Say you wish to design a website that houses many digital
        photos, and displays them with captions and a datestamp.  Now,
        your set of photos is constantly changing, so you'd like to
        have as much of this site automated as possible.  These photos
        can be quite large, so as is common with sites of this nature,
        you want to provide smaller thumbnail images to your site
        visitors.  You can do this with traditional files.  That is,
        you can have your <filename>image123.jpg</filename> and an
        <filename>image123-thumbnail.jpg</filename> side-by-side in a
        directory.  Or if you want to keep the filenames the same, you
        might have your thumbnails in a different directory, like
        <filename>thumbnails/image123.jpg</filename>.  You can also
        store your captions and datestamps in a similar fashion, again
        separated from the original image file.  Soon, your tree of
        files is a mess, and grows in multiples with each new photo
        added to the site.</para>

     <para>Now consider the same setup using Subversion's file
        properties.  Imagine having a single image file,
        <filename>image123.jpg</filename>, and then properties set on
        that file named <literal>caption</literal>,
        <literal>datestamp</literal>, and even
        <literal>thumbnail</literal>.  Now your working copy directory
        looks much more manageable&mdash;in fact, it looks like there
        are nothing but image files in it.  But your automation
        scripts know better.  They know that they can use
        <command>svn</command> (or better yet, they can use the
        Subversion language bindings&mdash;see <xref
        linkend="svn-ch-7-sect-2.3" />) to dig out the extra
        information that your site needs to display without having to
        read an index file or play path manipulation games.</para>

      <para>How (and if) you use Subversion properties is up to you.
        As we mentioned, Subversion has it own uses for properties,
        which we'll discuss a little later in this chapter.  But
        first, let's discuss how to manipulate options using the
        <command>svn</command> program.</para>

    </sect2>

    <!-- ***************************************************************** -->
    <sect2 id="svn-ch-6-sect-2.2">
      <title>Manipulating Properties</title>

      <para>The <command>svn</command> command affords a few ways to
        add or modify file and directory properties.  For properties
        with short, human-readable values, perhaps the simplest way to
        add a new property is to specify the property name and value
        on the command-line of <command>propset</command>
        subcommand.</para>

      <screen>
$ svn propset copyright '(c) 2003 Red-Bean Software' calc/button.c
property `copyright' set on 'calc/button.c'
$
</screen>
       
      <para>But we've been touting the flexibility that Subversion
        offers for your property values.  And if you are planning to
        have a multi-line textual, or even binary, property value, you
        probably do not want to supply that value on the command-line.
        So the <command>propset</command> subcommand takes a
        <option>--file (-F)</option> option for specifying the name of
        a file which contains the new property value.</para>

      <screen>
$ svn propset license -F /path/to/LICENSE calc/button.c
property `license' set on 'calc/button.c'
$
</screen>

      <para>In addition to the <command>propset</command> command, the
        <command>svn</command> program supplies the
        <command>propedit</command> command.  This command uses the
        configured editor program (see <xref
        linkend="svn-ch-6-sect-1.3.2" />) to add or modify properties.
        When you run the command, <command>svn</command> invokes your
        editor program on a temporary file that contains the current
        value of the property (or which is empty, if you are adding a
        new property).  Then, you just modify that value in your
        editor program until it represents the new value you wish to
        store for the property, save the temporary file, and then exit
        the editor program.  If Subversion detects that you've
        actually changed the existing value of the property, it will
        accept that as the new property value.  If you exit your
        editor without making any changes, no property modification
        will occur.</para>

      <screen>
$ svn propedit copyright calc/button.c  ### exit the editor without changes
No changes to property `copyright' on `calc/button.c'
$
</screen>

      <para>We should note that, as with other <command>svn</command>
        subcommands, those related to properties can act on multiple
        paths at once.  This enables you to modify properties on whole
        sets of files with a single command.  For example, we could
        have done:</para>

      <screen>
$ svn propset copyright '(c) 2002 Red-Bean Software' calc/*
property `copyright' set on 'calc/Makefile'
property `copyright' set on 'calc/button.c'
property `copyright' set on 'calc/integer.c'
&hellip;
$
</screen>

      <para>All of this property adding and editing isn't really very
        useful if you can't easily get the stored property value.  So
        the <command>svn</command> program supplies two subcommands
        for displaying the names and values of properties stored on
        files and directories.  The <command>svn proplist</command>
        command will list the names of properties which exist on a
        path.  Once you know the names of the properties on the node,
        you can request their values individually using <command>svn
        propget</command>.  This command will, given a path (or set of
        paths) and a property name, print the value of the property to
        the standard output stream.</para>

      <screen>
$ svn proplist calc/button.c
Properties on 'calc/button.c':
  copyright
  license
$ svn propget copyright calc/button.c
(c) 2003 Red-Bean Software
</screen>

      <para>There's even a variation of the
        <command>proplist</command> command which will list both the
        name and value of all of the properties.  Simply supply the
        <option>--verbose (-v)</option> option.</para>

      <screen>
$ svn proplist --verbose calc/button.c
Properties on 'calc/button.c':

      <para>The last property-related subcommand is
        <command>propdel</command>.  Since Subversion allows you to
        store properties with empty values, you can't remove a
        property altogether using <command>propedit</command> or
        <command>propset</command>.  For example, this command will
        <emphasis>not</emphasis> work:</para>

      <screen>
$ svn propset license '' calc/button.c
property `license' set on 'calc/button.c'
$ svn proplist --verbose calc/button.c
Properties on 'calc/button.c':
  copyright : (c) 2003 Red-Bean Software
  license : 
$
</screen>

      <para>You need to use the <command>propdel</command> command to
        delete properties altogether.  The syntax is similar to the
        other property commands:</para>

      <screen>
$ svn propdel license calc/button.c
property `foo' deleted from ''.
$ svn proplist --verbose calc/button.c
Properties on 'calc/button.c':
  copyright : (c) 2003 Red-Bean Software
$
</screen>

      <para>Now that you are now familiar with all of the
        property-related <command>svn</command> subcommands, let's see
        how property modifications affect the usual Subversion
        workflow.  As we mentioned earlier, file and directory
        properties are versioned, just like your file contents.  As a
        result, Subversion provides the same opportunies for
        merging&mdash;in cleanly or conflicting fashions&mdash;someone
        else's modifications into your own.</para>

      <sidebar>
        <title>Modifying Revision Properties</title>

        <para>Remember those unversioned revision properties?  You can
          modify those, too, with the <command>svn</command> program.
          Simply add the <option>--revprop</option> command-line
          parameter, and specify the revision whose property you wish
          to modify.  Since revisions are global, you don't need to
          specify a path in this case as long as you are positioned in
          the working copy of the repository whose revision property
          you wish to modify.  For example, you might want to replace
          the commit log message of an existing revision.
          <footnote>
            <para>Fixing spelling errors, grammatical gotchas, and
              <quote>just-plain-wrongness</quote> in commit log
              messages is perhaps the most common use-case for the
              <option>--revprop</option> option.</para>
          </footnote></para>

        <screen>
$ svn propset svn:log '* button.c: Fix a compiler warning.' -r11 --revprop
property `status' set on repository revision '11'
$
</screen>

        <para>Note that the ability to modify these unversioned
          properties must be explicitly added by the repository
          administrator (see <xref linkend="svn-ch-5-sect-2.1" />).
          Since the properties aren't versioned, you run the risk of
          losing information if you aren't careful with your edits.
          The repository administrator can setup methods to protect
          against this lossage, but by default, modification of
          unversioned properties is disabled.</para>

      </sidebar>

      <para>And as with file contents, your property changes are local
        modifications, only made permanent when you commit them to the
        repository with <command>svn commit</command>.  Your property
        changes can be easily unmade, too&mdash;the <command>svn
        revert</command> command will restore your files and
        directories to their un-edited states, contents, properties,
        and all.  Also, you can receive interesting information about
        the state of your file and directory properties by using the
        <command>svn status</command> and <command>svn diff</command>
        commands.</para>

      <screen>
$ svn status calc/button.c
 M     calc/button.c
$ svn diff calc/button.c
Property changes on: calc/button.c
___________________________________________________________________
Name: copyright
   + (c) 2003 Red-Bean Software

$
</screen>

      <para>Notice how the <command>status</command> subcommand
        displays <literal>M</literal> in the second column instead of
        the first.  That is because we have modified the properties on
        <filename>calc/button.c</filename>, but not modified its
        textual contents.  Had we changed both, we would have seen
        <literal>M</literal> in the first column, too (see <xref
        linkend="svn-ch-3-sect-4.3.1" />).</para>

      <sidebar>
        <title>Property Conflicts</title>

        <para>As with file contents, local property modifications can
          conflict with changes committed by someone else.  If you
          update your working copy directory and receive property
          changes on a versioned resource that clash with your own,
          Subversion will report that the resource is in a conflicted
          state.</para>
 
        <screen>
% svn update calc
M  calc/Makefile.in
 C calc/button.c
Updated to revision 143.
$ 
</screen>
         
        <para>Subversion will also create, in the same directory as
          the conflicted resource, a file with a
          <filename>.prej</filename> extension which contains the
          details of the conflict.  You should examine the contents of
          this file so you can decide how to resolve the conflict.
          Until the conflict is resolved, you will see a
          <literal>C</literal> in the second column of <command>svn
          status</command> output for that resource, and attempts to
          commit your local modifications will fail.</para>

        <screen>
$ svn status calc
 C     calc/button.c
?      calc/button.c.prej
$ cat calc/button.c.prej 
prop `linecount': user set to '1256', but update set to '1301'.
$
</screen>
 
        <para>To resolve property conflicts, simply ensure that the
          conflicting properties contain the values that they should,
          and then use the <command>svn resolve</command> command to
          alert Subversion that you have manually resolved the
          problem.</para>

      </sidebar>

      <para>You might also have noticed the non-standard way that
        Subversion currently displays property differences.  You can
        still run <command>svn diff</command> and redirect the output
        to create a usable patch file.  The <command>patch</command>
        program will ignore property patches&mdash;as a rule, it
        ignores any noise it can't understand.  This does
        unfortunately mean that to fully apply a patch generated by
        <command>svn diff</command>, any property modifications will
        need to be applied by hand.</para>

      <para>As you can see, the presence of property modifications has
        no outstanding effect on the typical Subversion workflow.
        Your general patterns of updating your working copy, checking
        the status of your files and directories, reporting on the
        modifications you have made, and committing those
        modifications to the repository are completely immune to the
        presence or absence of properties.  The <command>svn</command>
        program has some additional subcommands for actually making
        property changes, but that is the only noticeable assymmetry.</para>

     <title>Special properties</title>

      <para>Subversion has no particular policy regarding
        properties&mdash;you can use them for any purpose.  Subversion
        asks only that you not use property names that begin with the
        prefix <literal>svn:</literal>.  That's the namespace that its
        sets aside for its own use.  In fact, Subversion defines
        certain properties that have magical effects on the files and
        directories to which they are attached.  In this section,
        we'll untangle the mystery, and describe how these special
        properties make your life just a little easier.</para>
      
      <sect3 id="svn-ch-6-sect-2.3.1">
        <title><literal>svn:executable</literal></title>
 
        <para>The <literal>svn:executable</literal> property is used
          to control a versioned file's filesystem-level execute
          permission bit in a semi-automated way.  This property has
          no defined values&mdash;its mere presence indicates a desire
          the execute permission bit to be kept enabled by Subversion.
          Removing this property will restore full control of the
          execute bit back to the operating system.</para>

        <para>On many operating systems, the ability to execute a file
          as a command is governed by the presence of an execute
          permission bit.  This bit usually defaults to being
          disabled, and must be explicitly enabled by the user for
          each file that needs it.  In a working copy, new files are
          being created all the time as new versions of existing files
          are received during an update.  This means that you might
          enable the execute bit on a file, then update your working
          copy, and if that file was changed as part of the update,
          its execute bit might get disabled.  So, Subversion provides
          the <literal>svn:executable</literal> property as a way to
          keep the execute bit enabled.</para>

        <para>This property has no effect on filesystems that have no
          concept of an executable permission bit, such as FAT32 and
          NTFS.
          <footnote>
            <para>The Windows filesystems use file extensions (such as
              <literal>.EXE</literal>, <literal>.BAT</literal>, and

              files.</para>
          </footnote>
          Also, although it has no defined values, Subversion will force
          its value to <literal>*</literal> when setting this property.
          Finally, this property is valid only on files, not on
          directories.</para>

      <sect3 id="svn-ch-6-sect-2.3.2">
        <title><literal>svn:mime-type</literal></title>
        
        <para>The <literal>svn:mime-type</literal> property serves
          many purposes in Subversion.  Besides being a
          general-purpose storage location for a file's Multipurpose
          Internet Mail Extensions (MIME) classification, the value of
          this property determines several behavioral characteristics
          of Subversion itself.</para>

        <para>For example, if a file's
          <literal>svn:mime-type</literal> property is set to a
          non-text MIME type (generally, something that doesn't begin
          with <literal>text/</literal>, though there are exceptions),
          Subversion will assume that the file contains
          binary&mdash;that is, not human-readable&mdash;data.  One of
          the benefits that Subversion typically provides is
          contextual, line-based merging of changes received from the
          server during an update into your working file.  But for
          files believed to contain binary data, there is no concept
          of a <quote>line</quote>.  So, for those files, Subversion
          does not attempt to perform contextual merges during
          updates.  Instead, any time you have locally modified a
          binary working copy file that is also being updated, your
          file is renamed with a <filename>.orig</filename> extension,
          and then Subversion stores a new working copy file that
          contains the changes received during the update, but not
          your own local modifications, at the original filename.
          This behavior is really for the protection of the user
          against failed attempts at performing contextual merges on
          files that simply cannot be contextually merged.</para>

        <para>Subversion assists users by running a binary-detection
          algorithm in the <command>svn import</command> and
          <command>svn add</command> subcommands.  These subcommands
          use a heuristic to guess at a file's
          <quote>binary-ness</quote>, and then set the
          <literal>svn:mime-type</literal> property to
          <literal>application/octet-stream</literal> (the generic
          <quote>this is a collection of bytes</quote> MIME type) on
          any files that are deemed binary.  If Subversion guesses
          wrong, or if you wish to set the
          <literal>svn:mime-type</literal> property to something more
          accurate&mdash;perhaps <literal>image/png</literal> or
          <literal>application/x-shockwave-flash</literal>&mdash;you
          can always remove or hand-edit the property.</para>

        <para>Finally, if the <literal>svn:mime-type</literal>
          property is set, then the Subversion Apache module will use
          its value to populate the <literal>Content-type:</literal>
          HTTP header when responding to GET request.  This gives a
          crucial clue to about how to display a file when perusing
          your repository with a web browser.</para>

      <sect3 id="svn-ch-6-sect-2.3.3">
        <title><literal>svn:ignore</literal></title>

        <para>The <literal>svn:ignore</literal> property contains a
          list of file patterns which certain Subversion operations
          will ignore.  Perhaps the most commonly used special
          property, it works in conjunction with the
          <literal>global-ignores</literal> run-time configuration
          option (see <xref linkend="svn-ch-6-sect-1.3.2" />) to
          filter unversioned files and directories out of commands
          like <command>svn status</command>.</para>

        <para>The rationale behind the <literal>svn:ignore</literal>
          property is easily explained.  Subversion does not assume
          that every file or subdirectory in a working copy directory
          is intended for version control.  Resources must be
          explicitly placed under Subversion's management using the
          <command>svn add</command> command.  As a result, there are
          often many resources in a working copy that are not
          versioned.</para>

        <para>Now, the <command>svn status</command> command displays
          as part of its output every unversioned file or subdirectory
          in a working copy that is not already filtered out by the
          <literal>global-ignores</literal> option (or its built-in
          default value).  This is done so that users can see if
          perhaps they've forgotten to add a resource to version
          control.</para>

       <para>But Subversion cannot possibly guess the names of
          every resource that should be ignored.  Also, quite often
          there are things that should be ignored in
          <emphasis>every</emphasis> working copy of a particular
          repository.  To force every user of that repository to add
          patterns for those resources to their run-time configuration
          areas would be not just a burden, but has the potential to
          clash with the configuration needs of other working copies
          that the user has checked out.</para>

        <para>The solution is to store ignore patterns that are unique
          to the resources likely to appear in a given directory with
          the directory itself.  Common examples of unversioned
          resources that are basically unique to a directory, yet
          likely to appear there, include output from program
          compilations.  Or&mdash;to use an example more appropriate
          to this book&mdash;the HTML, PDF, or PostScript files
          generated as the result of a conversion of some source
          DocBook XML files to a more legible output format.</para>

          <title>Ignore Patterns for CVS Users</title>
        
          <para>The Subversion <literal>svn:ignore</literal> property
            is very similar in syntax and function to the CVS
            <filename>.cvsignore</filename> file.  In fact, if you are
            migrating a CVS working copy to Subversion, you can
            directly migrate the ignore patterns by the
            <filename>.cvsignore</filename> file as input file to the
            <command>svn propset</command> command:</para>
       
          <screen>
$ svn propset svn:ignore -F .cvsignore .
property `svn:ignore' set on '.'
$
</screen>        

          <para>There are, however, some differences in the ways that
            CVS and Subversion handle ignore patters.  The two systems
            use the ignore patterns at some different times, and there
            are slight discrepencies in what the ignore patterns apply
            to.  Also, Subversion does not recognize the use of the
            <literal>!</literal> pattern as a reset back to having no
            ignore patterns at all.  Finally, while the
            <filename>.cvsignore</filename> patterns apply recursively
            from the directory in which they reside, Subversion's
            <literal>svn:ignore</literal> property applies only to the
            directory on which it is set.</para>

        </sidebar>

        <para>For this purpose, the <literal>svn:ignore</literal>
          property is the solution.  Its value is a multi-line
          collection of file patterns, one pattern per line.  The
          property is set on the directory in which your wish the
          patterns to be applied.
          <footnote>
            <para>The patterns are strictly for that
              directory&mdash;they do not carry recursively into
              subdirectories.</para>
          </footnote>
          For example, say you have the following output from
          <command>svn status</command>:</para>

       <screen>
$ svn status calc
 M     calc/button.c
?      calc/calculator
?      calc/data.c
?      calc/debug_log
?      calc/debug_log.1
?      calc/debug_log.2.gz
?      calc/debug_log.3.gz
</screen>

        <para>In this example, you have made some property
          modifications to <filename>button.c</filename>, but in your
          working copy you also have some unversioned files, in this
          case, the latest <filename>calculator</filename> program
          that you've compiled from your source code, a source file
          named <filename>data.c</filename>, and a set of debugging
          output logfiles.  Now, you know that your build system
          always results in the <filename>calculator</filename>
          program being generated.
          <footnote>
            <para>Isn't that the whole point of a build system?</para>
          </footnote>
          And you know that your test suite always leaves those
          debugging log files lying around.  These facts are true for
          all working copies, not just your own.  And you know that
          you aren't interested in seeing those things every time you
          run <command>svn status</command>.  So you use <command>svn
          propedit svn:ignore calc</command> to add some ignore
          patterns to the <filename>calc</filename> directory.  For
          example, you might add this as the new value of the
          <literal>svn:ignore</literal> property:</para>

        <programlisting>
calculator
debug_log*
</programlisting>

        <para>After you've added this property, you will now have a
          local property modification on the <filename>calc</filename>
          directory.  But notice what else is different about your
          <command>svn status</command> output:</para>

        <screen>
$ svn status
 M     calc
 M     calc/button.c
?      calc/data.c
</screen>

        <para>Now, all the cruft is missing from the output!  Of
          course, those files are still in your working copy.
          Subversion is simply not reminding you that they are present
          and unversioned.  And now with all the trivial noise removed
          from the display, you are left with more interesting
          items&mdash; such as that source code file that you probably
          forgot to add to version control.</para>

        <para>If you want to see the ignored files, you can pass the 
          <command>--no-ignore</command> option to subversion:</para>

<screen>
$ svn status --no-ignore
 M     calc/button.c
I      calc/calculator
?      calc/data.c
I      calc/debug_log
I      calc/debug_log.1
I      calc/debug_log.2.gz

      <sect3 id="svn-ch-6-sect-2.3.4">
        <title><literal>svn:keywords</literal></title>

        <para>Subversion has the ability to substitute
          <firstterm>keywords</firstterm>&mdash;pieces of useful,
          dynamic information about a versioned file&mdash;into the
          contents of the file itself.  Keywords generally describe
          information about the last time the file was known to be
          modified.  Because this information changes each time the
          file changes, and more importantly, just
          <emphasis>after</emphasis> the file changes, it is a hassle
          for any process except the version control system to keep
          the data completely up-to-date.  Left to human authors, the
          information would inevitably grow stale.</para>

        <para>For example, say you have a document in which you would
          like to display the last date on which it was modified.  You
          could burden every author of that document to, just before
          committing their changes, also tweak the part of the
          document that describes when it was last changed.  But
          sooner or later, someone would forget to do that.  Instead
          simply ask Subversion to perform keyword substitution on the
          <literal>LastChangedDate</literal> keyword.  You control
          where the keyword is inserted into your document by placing
          a <firstterm>keyword anchor</firstterm> at the desired
          location in the file.  This anchor is just a string of text
          formatted as
          <literal>$</literal><replaceable>KeywordName</replaceable><literal>$</literal></para>

        <para>Subversion defines the list of keywords available for
          substitution.  That list contains the following five
          keywords, some of which have shorter aliases that you can
          also use:</para>

        <para>Simply adding keyword anchor text to your file does
          nothing special.  Subversion will never attempt to perform
          textual substitutions on your file contents unless
          explicitly asked to do so.  After all, you might be writing
          a document
          <footnote>
            <para>&hellip; or maybe even a section of a book &hellip;</para>
          </footnote> 
          about how to use keywords, and you don't want Subversion to
          substitute your beautiful examples of un-substited keyword
          anchors!</para>

        <para>To tell Subversion whether or not to substitute keywords
          on a particular file, we again turn to the property-related
          subcommands.  The <literal>svn:keywords</literal> property,
          when set on a versioned file, controls which keywords will
          be substituted on that file.  The value is a space-delimited
          list of the keyword names or aliases found in the previous
          table.</para>

        <para>For example, say you have a versioned file named
          <filename>weather.txt</filename> that looks like
          this:</para>

        <programlisting>

</programlisting>
        
        <para>With no <literal>svn:keywords</literal> property set on
          that file, Subversion will do nothing special.  Now, let's
          enable substitution of the
          <literal>LastChangedDate</literal> keyword.</para>

        <screen>
$ svn propset svn:keywords "LastChangedDate Author" weather.txt
property `svn:keywords' set on 'weather.txt'
$
</screen>        

        <para>Now you have made a local property modification on the
          <filename>weather.txt</filename> file.  You will see no
          changes to the file's contents (unless you made some of your
          own prior to setting the property).  Notice that the file
          contained a keyword anchor for the <literal>Rev</literal>
          keyword, yet we did not include that keyword in the property
          value we set.  Subversion will happily ignore requests to
          substitute keywords that are not present in the file, and
          will not substitute keywords that are not present in the
          <literal>svn:keywords</literal> property value.</para>

        <sidebar>
          <title>Keywords and Spurious Differences</title>

          <para>The user-visible result of keyword substitution might
            lead you to think that every version of a file with that
            feature in use differs from the previous version in at
            least the area where the keyword anchor was placed.
            However, this is actually not the case.  While checking
            for local modifications during <command>svn
            diff</command>, and before transmitting those local
            modifications during <command>svn commit</command>,
            Subversion <quote>un-substitutes</quote> any keywords that
            it previously substituted.  The result is that the
            versions of the file that are stored in the repository
            contain only the real modifications that users make to the
            file.</para>

        </sidebar>

        <para>Immediately after you commit this property change,
          Subversion will update your working file with the new
          substitute text.  Instead of seeing your keyword anchor
          <literal>$LastChangedDate$</literal>, you'll see its
          substituted result.  That result also contains the name of
          the keyword, and continues to be bounded by the dollar sign
          (<literal>$</literal>) characters.  And as we predicted, the
          <literal>Rev</literal> keyword was not substituted because
          we didn't ask for it to be.</para>

          time the keywords in your <filename>weather.txt</filename>

        <para>This means that by default, Subversion doesn't pay any
          attention to the type of <firstterm>end-of-line (EOL)
          markers</firstterm> used in your files.  Unfortunately,
          different operating system use different tokens to represent
          the end of a line of text in a file.  For example, the usual
          line ending token used by software on the Windows platform
          is a pair of ASCII control characters&mdash;carriage return
          (<literal>CR</literal>) and line feed
          (<literal>LF</literal>).  Unix software, however, just uses
          the <literal>LF</literal> character to denote the end of a
          line.</para>

        <para>Not all of the various tools on these operating systems
          are prepared to understand files that contain line endings
          in a format that differs from the <firstterm>native line
          ending style</firstterm> of the operating system on which
          they are running.  Common results are that Unix programs
          treat the <literal>CR</literal> character present in Windows
          files as a regular character (usually rendered as
          <literal>^M</literal>), and that Windows programs combine
          all of the lines of a Unix file into one giant line because
          no carriage return-linefeed (or <literal>CRLF</literal>)
          character combination was found to denote the end of
          line.</para>

        <para>This sensitivity to foreign EOL markers can become
          frustrating for folks who share a file across different
          operating systems.  For example, consider a source code
          file, and developers that edit this file on both Windows and
          Unix systems.  If all the developers always use tools which
          preserve the line ending style of the file, no problems
          occur.</para>

        <para>But in practice, many common tools either fail to
          properly read a file with foreign EOL markers, or they
          convert the file's line endings to the native style when the
          file is saved.  If the former is true for a developer, he
          has to use an external conversion utility (such as
          <command>dos2unix</command> or its companion,
          <command>unix2dos</command>) to prepare the file for
          editing.  The latter case requires no extra preparation.
          But both cases result in a file that differs from the
          original quite literally on every line!  Prior to committing
          his changes, the user has two choices.  Either he can use a
          conversion utility to restore the modified file to the same
          line ending style that it was in before his edits were made.
          Or, he can simply commit the file&mdash;new EOL markers and
          all.</para>

        <para>The result of scenarios like these include wasted time
          and unnecessary modifications to committed files.  Wasted
          time is painful enough.  But when commits change every line
          in a file, this complicates the job of determining which of
          those lines were changed in a non-trivial way.  Where was
          that bug really fixed?  On what line was a syntax error
          introduced?</para>

        <para>The solution this problem is the
          <literal>svn:eol-style</literal> property.  When this
          property is set to a valid value, Subversion uses it to
          determine what special processing to perform on the file so
          that the file's line ending style isn't flip-flopping with
          every commit that comes from a different operating
          system.  The valid values are:</para>

        <variablelist>
          <varlistentry>
            <term><literal>native</literal></term>
            <listitem>
              <para>This causes the file to contain the EOL markers
                that are native to the operating system on which
                Subversion was run.  In other words, if a user on a
                Windows machine checks out a working copy that
                contains a file with a
                <literal>svn:eol-style</literal> property set to
                <literal>native</literal>, that file will contain
                <literal>CRLF</literal> EOL markers.  A unix user
                checking out a working copy which contains the same
                file will see <literal>LF</literal> EOL markers in his
                copy of the file.</para>

              <para>Note that Subversion will actually store the file
                in the repository using normalized
                <literal>LF</literal> EOL markers regardless of the
                operating system.  This is basically transparent to
                the user, though.</para>

                ending style is not very common.  It was used on older

    <title>Externals Definitions</title>
    
    <para>Sometimes it is useful to construct a working copy that is
      made out of a number of different checkouts.  For example, you
      may want different subdirectories to come from different
      locations in a repository, or perhaps from different
      repositories altogether.  You could certainly setup such a
      scenario by hand&mdash;using <command>svn checkout</command> to
      create the sort of nested working copy structure you are trying
      to achieve.  But if this layout is important for everyone who
      uses your repository, every other user will need to perform the
      same checkout operations that you did.</para>

    <para>Fortunately, Subversion provides support for
      <firstterm>externals definitions</firstterm>.  An externals
      definition is a mapping of a local directory to the URL of a
      versioned resource.  In Subversion, you declare externals
      definitions in groups using the <literal>svn:externals</literal>
      property.  This property is set on a versioned directory, and
      its value is a multi-line table of subdirectories (relative to
      the versioned directory on which the property is set) and
      Subversion repository URLs.</para>

third-party/skins/toolkit   http://svn.red-bean.com/repos/skin-maker
</screen>

    <para>The convenience of the <literal>svn:externals</literal>
      property is that once it is set on a versioned directory,
      everyone who checks out a working copy with that directory also
      gets the benefit of the externals definition.  In other words,
      once one person has made the effort to define those nested
      working copy checkouts, no one else has to
      bother&mdash;Subversion will, upon checkout of the original
      working copy, also checkout the external working copies.</para>

    <para>Note the previous externals definition example.  When
      someone checks out a working copy of the
      <filename>calc</filename> directory, Subversion also continues
      to checkout the items found in its externals definition.</para>

    <para>If you need to change the externals definition, you can do
      so using the regular property modification subcommands.  When
      you commit a change to the <literal>svn:externals</literal>
      property, Subversion will syncronize the checked-out items
      against the changed externals definition when you next run
      <command>svn update</command>.  The same thing will happen when
      others update their working copies and receive your changes to
      the externals definition.</para>

    <para>As is especially the case when developing software, the data
      that you maintain under version control is often closely related
      to, or perhaps dependent upon, someone else's data.  Generally,
      the needs of your project will dictate that you stay as
      up-to-date as possible with the data provided by that external
      entity without sacrificing the stability of your own project.
      This scenario plays itself out all the time&mdash;anywhere that
      the information generated by one group of people has a direct
      effect on that which is generated by another group.</para>
 
    <para>For example, software developers might be working on an
      application which makes use of a third-party library.
      Subversion has just such a relationship with the Apache Portable
      Runtime library (see <xref linkend="svn-ch-7-sect-2.1" />).  The
      Subversion source code depends on the APR library for all its
      portability needs.  In earlier stages of Subversion's
      development, the project closely tracked APR's changing API,
      always sticking to the <quote>bleeding edge</quote> of the
      library's code churn.  Now that both APR and Subversion have
      matured, Subversion attempts to syncronize with APR's library
      API only at well-tested, stable release points.</para>

    <para>Now, if your project depends on someone else's information,
      there are several ways that you could attempt to syncronize that
      information with your own.  Most painfully, you could issue oral
      or written instructions to all the contributors of your project,
      telling them to make sure that they have the specific versions
      of that third-party information that your project needs.  If the
      third-party information is maintained in a Subversion
      repository, you could also use Subversion's externals
      definitions to effectively <quote>pin down</quote> specific
      versions of that information to some location in your own
      working copy directory (see <xref linkend="svn-ch-6-sect-3" />).</para>

    <para>But sometimes you want to maintain custom modifications to
      third-party data in your own version control system.  Returning
      to the software development example, programmers might need to
      make modifications to that third-party library for their own
      purposes.  These modifications might include new functionality
      or bug fixes, maintained internally only until they become part
      of an official release of the third-party library.  Or the
      changes might never be relayed back to the library maintainers,
      existing solely as custom tweaks to make the library further
      suit the needs of the software developers.</para>

    <para>Now you face an interesting situation.  Your project could
      house its custom modifications to the third-party data in some
      disjointed fashion, such as using patch files or full-fledged
      alternate versions of files and directories.  But these quickly
      become maintenance headaches, requiring some mechanism by which
      to apply your custom changes to the third-party data, and
      necessitating regeneration of those changes with each successive
      version of the third-party data that you track.</para>

    <para>The solution to this problem is to use <firstterm>vendor
      branches</firstterm>.  A vendor branch is a directory tree in
      your own version control system which contains information
      provided by a third-party entity, or vendor.  Each version of
      the vendor's data that you decide to absorb into your project is
      called a <firstterm>vendor drop</firstterm>.</para> 

    <para>Vendor branches provide two key benefits.  First, by storing
      the currently supported vendor drop in your own version control
      system, the members of your project never need to question
      whether they have the right version of the vendor's data.  They
      simply receive that correct version as part of their regular
      working copy updates.  Secondly, because the data lives in your
      own Subversion repository, you can store your custom changes to
      it in-place&mdash;you have no more need of an automated (or
      worse, manual) method for swapping in your customizations.</para>

    <!-- ***************************************************************** -->
    <sect2 id="svn-ch-6-sect-4.1">
      <title>General Vendor Branch Management Procedure</title>

      <para>Managing vendor branches generally works like this.  You
        create a top-level directory (such as
        <filename>/vendor</filename>) to hold the vendor branches.
        Then you import the third party code into a subdirectory of
        that top-level directory.  You then copy that subdirectory
        into your main development branch (for example,
        <filename>/trunk</filename>) at the appropriate location.  You
        always make your local changes in the main development branch.
        With each new release of the code you are tracking you bring
        it into the vendor branch and merge the changes into
        <filename>/trunk</filename>, resolving whatever conflicts
        occur between your local changes and the upstream
        changes.</para>

      <para>Perhaps an example will help to clarify this algorithm.
        We'll use a scenario where your development team is creating a
        calculator program that links against a third-party complex
        number arithmetic library, libcomplex.  We'll begin with the
        initial creation of the vendor branch, and the import of the
        first vendor drop.</para>

      <screen>
$ svn mkdir http://svn.example.com/repos/calc/vendor/libcomplex  \

&hellip;
</screen>
    
      <para>We now have the current version of the libcomplex source
        code in <filename>/vendor/libcomplex/current</filename>.  Now,
        we tag that version (see <xref linkend="svn-ch-4-sect-6" />)
        and then copy it into the main development branch so we can
        make our customizations to it.</para>

&hellip;
</screen>

      <para>We check out our project's main branch&mdash;which now
        includes a copy of the first vendor drop&mdash;and we get to
        work customizing the libcomplex code.  Before we know it, our
        modified version of libcomplex is now completely integrated
        into our calculator program.
        <footnote>
          <para>And entirely bug-free, of course!</para>
        </footnote>
      </para>

      <para>A few weeks later, the developers of libcomplex release a
        new version of their library&mdash;version 1.1&mdash;which
        contains some features and functionality that we really want.
        But we'd like to upgrade to this new version without losing
        our customizations to the existing version.  As you might have
        guessed, what we essentially would like to do is to replace
        our current baseline version of libcomplex 1.0 with a copy of
        libcomplex 1.1, and then re-apply the custom modifications we
        previously made to that library to the new version.</para>
      
      <para>To perform this upgrade, we checkout a copy of our vendor
        branch, and replace the <literal>current</literal> version
        with the new libcomplex 1.1 source code.  After committing
        this change, our <literal>current</literal> branch now
        contains the new vendor drop.  We tag the new version, and
        then merge the differences between the tag of the previous
        version and the new current version into our main development
        branch.</para>

      <screen>
$ cd working-copies/calc
$ svn merge http://svn.example.com/repos/vendor/libcomplex/1.0      \
            http://svn.example.com/repos/vendor/libcomplex/current  \
            libcomplex
&hellip; # resolve all the conflicts between their changes and our changes
$ svn commit -m 'merging libcomplex-1.1 into the main branch'
&hellip;
</screen>

      <para>In the trivial use-case, the new version of our
        third-party tool would look, from a files-and-directories
        point of view, just like the previous version.  In other
        words, none of the libcomplex source files would have been
        deleted, renamed or moved to different locations&mdash;in
        short, in a perfect world, our modifications would apply
        cleanly to the new version of the library, with absolutely no
        complications or conflicts.</para>

     <para>But things aren't always that simple, and in fact it is
       quite common for source files to get moved around between
       releases of software.  This complicates the process of ensuring
       that our modifications are still valid for the new version of
       code, and can quickly degrade into a situation where we have to
       manually recreate our customizations in the new version.  Once
       Subversion knows about the history of a given source
       file&mdash;including all its previous locations&mdash;the
       process of merging in the new version of the library is pretty
       simple.  But we are responsible for telling Subversion how the
       source file layout changed from vendor drop to vendor
       drop.</para>

        the URL&mdash;relative the first argument&mdash;into which the
        current vendor drop will be imported.  Finally, the third
        argument is the local directory to import.  Using our previous
        example, a typical run of <command>svn_load_dirs.pl</command>
        might look like:</para>

      <screen>
$ svn_load_dirs.pl http://svn.example.com/repos/calc/vendor/libcomplex \
                   current                                             \
                   /path/to/libcomplex-1.1
&hellip;
</screen>

      <para>You can indicate that you'd like
        <command>svn_load_dirs.pl</command> to tag the new vendor drop
        by passing the <option>-t</option> command-line option and
        specifying a tag name.  This tag is another URL relative to
        the first program argument.</para>

      <screen>
$ svn_load_dirs.pl -t libcomplex-1.1                                   \
                   http://svn.example.com/repos/calc/vendor/libcomplex \
                   current                                             \
                   /path/to/libcomplex-1.1
&hellip;
</screen>

      <para>When you run <command>svn_load_dirs.pl</command>, it
        examines the contents of your existing <quote>current</quote>
        vendor drop, and compares them with the proposed new vendor
        drop.  In the trivial case, there will be no files that are in
        one version and not the other, and the script will perform the
        new import without incident.  If, however, there are
        discrepencies in the file layouts between versions,
        <command>svn_load_dirs.pl</command> will prompt you for how
        you would like to resolve those differences.  For example, you
        will have the opportunity to tell the script that you know
        that the file <filename>math.c</filename> in version 1.0 of
        libcomplex was renamed to <filename>arithmetic.c</filename> in
        libcomplex 1.1.  Any discrepencies not explained by moves
        are treated as regular additions and deletions.</para>

      <para>The script also accepts a separate configuration file for
        setting properties on files and directories matching a regular
        expression that are <emphasis>added</emphasis> to the
        repository.  This configuration file is specified to
        <command>svn_load_dirs.pl</command> using the
        <option>-p</option> command-line option.  Each line of the
        configuration files is a whitespace-delimited set of two or
        four values: a Perl-style regular expression to match the
        added path against, a control keyword (either
        <literal>break</literal> or <literal>cont</literal>), and then
        optionally a property name and value.</para>

      <screen>
\.png$              break   svn:mime-type   image/png
\.jpe?g$            break   svn:mime-type   image/jpeg
\.m3u$              cont    svn:mime-type   audio/x-mpegurl
\.m3u$              break   svn:eol-style   LF
.*                  break   svn:eol-style   native
</screen>

      <para>For each added path, the configured property changes whose
        regular expression matches the path are applied in order,
        unless the control specification is <literal>break</literal>
        (which means that no more property changes should be applied
        to that path).  If the control specification is
        <literal>cont</literal>&mdash;an abbreviation for
        <literal>continue</literal>&mdash;then matching will continue
        with the next line of the configuration file.</para>

      <para>Any whitespace in the regular expression, property name,
        or property value must be surrounded by either single or
        double quote characters.  You can escape quote characters that
        are not used for wrapping whitespace by preceding them with a
        backslash (<literal>\</literal>) character.  The backslash
        escapes only quotes when parsing the configuration file, so do
        not protect any other characters beyond what is necessary for
        the regular expression.</para>
