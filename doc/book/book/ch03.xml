    <para>How to make a lovely gumbo with your Subversion client, in
      11 easy steps.</para>

    <para>This chapter goes into more of the gritty details of client
      commands.  For a first overview of the client's CVS-like
      <quote>copy-modify-merge</quote> model of development, see <xref
        linkend="svn-ch-2"/>.</para>
    
    <para>This chapter by no means covers every option to every client
      subcommand.  Instead, it's a conversational introduction to the
      most common tasks you'll encounter.  When in doubt, run
      <command>svn help</command>.</para>

    <para>Before reading on, here is the most important piece of
      information you'll ever need when using Subversion: <command>svn
        help</command>.  The Subversion command-line client tries to be
      self-documenting; at any time, a quick <command>svn help
        &lt;subcommand&gt;</command> will describe the syntax, switches,
      and behavior of <command>subcommand</command>.</para>

    <title>Initial Checkout</title>

    <para>Most of the time, you will start using a Subversion
      repository by doing a <firstterm>checkout</firstterm> of your
      project.  <quote>Checking out</quote> will provide you with a
      local copy of the <literal>HEAD</literal> (latest revision) of
      the Subversion repository that you checked out.</para>
    

    <screen>
      $ svn co http://svn.collab.net/repos/svn/trunk
      A  trunk/subversion.dsw
      A  trunk/svn_check.dsp
      A  trunk/COMMITTERS
      A  trunk/configure.in
      A  trunk/IDEAS
      &hellip;
      Checked out revision 2499.
    </screen>
    
    <para>Although the above example checks out the trunk directory,
      you can just as easily checkout any deep subdirectory of a
      repository by specifying the subdirectory in the checkout
      URL:</para>
    
    <screen>
      $ svn co http://svn.collab.net/repos/svn/trunk/doc/handbook
      A  handbook/svn-handbook.texi
      A  handbook/getting_started.texi
      A  handbook/outline.txt
      A  handbook/license.texi
      A  handbook/repos_admin.texi
      A  handbook/client.texi
      Checked out revision 2499.
    </screen>
    
    <para>Since Subversion uses a <quote>copy-modify-merge</quote>
      model instead of <quote>lock-modify-unlock,</quote> you're now
      ready to start making changes to the files that you've checked
      out, known collectively as your <firstterm>working
        copy</firstterm>. You can even delete the entire working copy
      and forget about it entirely&mdash;there's no need to notify the
      Subversion server unless you're ready to <firstterm>check
        in</firstterm> changes, a new file, or even a directory.</para>
    
    <para>Every directory in a working copy contains an
      <firstterm>administrative area</firstterm>, a subdirectory named
      <filename>.svn</filename>.  Normal <command>ls</command>
      commands won't show this subdirectory, but it's vital.  Whatever
      you do, don't delete or change anything in the administrative
      area!  Subversion depends on it to manage your working
      copy.</para>
    
    <para>You can run <command>svn help checkout</command> for command
      line options to checkout, although one option is very
      common and worth mentioning: you can specify a directory
      after your repository url.  This places your working copy
      into a new directory that you name.  For example:</para>
    
    <screen>
      $ svn co http://svn.collab.net/repos/svn/trunk subv
      A  subv/subversion.dsw
      A  subv/svn_check.dsp
      A  subv/COMMITTERS
      A  subv/configure.in
      A  subv/IDEAS

      <para>The <command>svn diff</command> command produces this
        output by comparing your working files against the cached
        <quote>pristine</quote> copies within the
        <filename>.svn</filename> area.  Files scheduled for addition
        are displayed as all added-text, and files scheduled for
        deletion are displayed as all deleted text.</para>
      
      <para>Now suppose you see this output, and realize that your
        changes to <filename>README</filename> are a mistake; perhaps
        you accidentally typed that text into the wrong file in your
        editor.</para>
      
      <para>The <command>svn revert} command is exactly for this purpose.  It
          throws away all changes to your file:</command></para>
           
      <screen>
        $ svn revert README
        Reverted ./README
      </screen>
        
      <para>The file is reverted to its pre-modified state by
        overwriting it with the cached <quote>pristine</quote> copy.
        But also note that <command>svn revert</command> can undo any
        scheduled operations&mdash;in case you decide that you don't
        want to add a new file after all, or that you don't want to
        remove something.</para>
           
      <sidebar>
        <para>All three of these commands (<command>svn
          status</command>, <command>svn diff</command>, <command>svn
          revert</command>) can be used without any network access
          (except for the <option>-u</option> switch to status).  This
          makes it easy to manage your changes-in-progress while
          traveling on an airplane, etc.</para>

        <para>Subversion manages this by keeping private caches of
          pristine versions of each versioned file inside of the
          <filename>.svn</filename> administrative areas.  This allows
          Subversion to report&mdash;and revert&mdash;local
          modifications to those files <emphasis>without network
          access</emphasis>.  CVS keeps no such cache, and as a result
          has to use the network layer for practically everything.
          This cache (called the "text-base") also allows Subversion
          to, during a commit, send the user's local modifications to
          the server as a compressed delta against the pristine
          version.  Since at commit time CVS has only the user's
          edited version of a file, it has to send that
          <emphasis>entire file</emphasis> to the server in order to
          relay the local modifications.</para>

    <title>Revisions</title>

    <para>As you may have noticed, many Subversion commands are able
      to process the <option>-r</option> switch.  Here we describe some
      special ways to specify revisions.</para>

    <para>The Subversion client understands a number of
      <firstterm>revision keywords</firstterm>.  These keywords can be
      used instead of integer arguments to the <option>-r</option>
      switch, and are resolved into specific revision numbers:</para>
    
    
    <variablelist>
      
      <varlistentry>
        <term>HEAD</term>
        <listitem>
          <para>The latest revision in the repository.</para>
        </listitem>
      </varlistentry>

      <varlistentry>
        <term>BASE</term>
        <listitem>
          <para>The <quote>pristine</quote> revision of an item in a
            working copy.</para>
        </listitem>
      </varlistentry>

      <varlistentry>
        <term>COMMITTED</term>
        <listitem>
          <para>The last revision in which an item changed.</para>
        </listitem>
      </varlistentry>

      <varlistentry>
        <term>PREV</term>
        <listitem>
          <para>The revision just <emphasis>before</emphasis> the last
            revision in which an item changed.  (Technically,
            COMMITTED - 1).</para>
        </listitem>
      </varlistentry>

    </variablelist>

    <para>Here are some examples of revision keywords in
      action:</para>

    <screen>
$ svn diff -r PREV:COMMITTED foo.c
# shows the last change committed to foo.c

$ svn log -r HEAD
# shows log message for the latest repository commit

$ svn diff -r HEAD
# compares your working file (with local mods) to the latest version
# in the repository.

$ svn diff -r BASE:HEAD foo.c
# compares your "pristine" foo.c (no local mods) with the latest version
# in the repository

$ svn log -r BASE:HEAD
# shows all commit logs since you last updated

$ svn update -r PREV foo.c
# rewinds the last change on foo.c.
# (foo.c's working revision is decreased.)

    <sect2 id="svn-ch-3-sect-7.1">
      <title><command>svn cleanup</command></title>

      <para>When Subversion modifies your working copy (or any
        information within <filename>.svn</filename>), it tries to do
        so as safely as possible.  Before changing anything, it writes
        its intentions to a logfile, then executes the commands in the
        logfile.  It's similar in design to a journaled filesystem; if
        the user hits Control-C or if the machine crashes, the
        logfiles are left lying around.  By re-executing the logfiles,
        the work can complete, and your working copy can get itself
        back into a consistent state.</para>

      <para>And this is exactly what <command>svn cleanup</command>
        does: it searches your working copy and re-runs any leftover
        logs, removing locks in the process.  Use this command if
        Subversion ever tells you that some part of your working copy
        is <quote>locked</quote>.  Also, <command>svn status</command>
        will display an <literal>L</literal> next to locked items:</para>

      <screen>
$ svn st
  L    ./somedir
M      ./somedir/foo.c

      <para>In general, we try to discourage users from directly
        reading the <filename>.svn/entries</filename> file used to
        track items.  Instead, curiosity can be quelled by using the
        <command>svn info</command> to display most of the tracked

      <para>There are two ways to use this command:</para>

      <screen>

Adding  mytree/subdir

      <para>The above example places the contents of directory
        <filename>mytree</filename> directly into the root of the
        repository:</para>

      <screen>
/foo.c
/bar.c
/subdir
/subdir/quux.h
      </screen>

      <para>If you give <command>svn import</command> a third
        argument, it will use the argument as the name of a new
        subdirectory to create within the URL.</para>

      <para>This is another convenience command, and it has two

      <para>First, it can be used to simultaneously create a new working copy

$ svn mkdir file:///usr/local/svn/newrepos/branches -m "made new dir"

      <para>Again, this is a form of immediate commit, so some sort of
