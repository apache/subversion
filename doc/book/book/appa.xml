<title>Subversion for CVS Users</title>

  <simplesect>

    <para>This appendix is a guide for CVS users new to Subversion.
      It's essentially a list of differences between the two systems
      as <quote>viewed from 10,000 feet.</quote> For each section, we
      provide backreferences to relevant chapters when
      possible.</para>

    <para>Although the goal of Subversion is to take over the current
      and future CVS user base, some new features and design changes
      were required to fix certain <quote>broken</quote> behaviors
      that CVS had.  This means that, as a CVS user, you may need to
      break habits&mdash;ones that you forgot were odd to begin
      with.</para>

    <title>Revision Numbers Are Different Now</title>

    <para>In CVS, revision numbers are per-file.  This is because CVS
      uses RCS as a backend; each file has a corresponding RCS file in
      the repository, and the repository is roughly laid out according
      to the structure of your project tree.</para>

    <para>In Subversion, the repository looks like a single
      filesystem.  Each commit results in an entirely new filesystem
      tree; in essence, the repository is an array of trees.  Each of
      these trees is labeled with a single revision number.  When
      someone talks about <quote>revision 54,</quote> they're talking
      about a particular tree (and indirectly, the way the filesystem
      looked after the 54th commit).</para>

    <para>Technically, it's not valid to talk about <quote>revision 5
      of <filename>foo.c</filename></quote>.  Instead, one would say
      <quote><filename>foo.c</filename> as it appears in revision
      5.</quote> Also, be careful when making assumptions about the
      evolution of a file.  In CVS, revisions 5 and 6 of
      <filename>foo.c</filename> are always different.  In Subversion,
      it's most likely that <filename>foo.c</filename> did
      <emphasis>not</emphasis> change between revisions 5 and
      6.</para>

    <title>Directory versions</title>
    
    <para>Subversion tracks tree structures, not just file contents.
      It's one of the biggest reasons Subversion was written to
      replace CVS.</para>

    <para>Here's what this means to you, as a former CVS user:</para>

      <itemizedlist>

        <listitem>
        <para>The <command>svn add</command> and <command>svn
          rm</command> commands work on directories now, just as they
          work on files.  So do <command>svn cp</command> and
          <command>svn mv</command>.  However, these commands do
          <emphasis>not</emphasis> cause any kind of immediate change
          in the repository.  Instead, the working items are simply
          <quote>scheduled</quote> for addition or deletion.  No
          repository changes happen until you run <command>svn
          commit</command>.</para>
        </listitem>

      <listitem>
        <para>Directories aren't dumb containers anymore; they have
          revision numbers like files.  (Or more properly, it's
          correct to talk about <quote>directory
          <filename>foo/</filename> in revision 5</quote>.)</para>
      </listitem>

    </itemizedlist>

    <para>Let's talk more about that last point.  Directory versioning
      is a hard problem; because we want to allow mixed-revision
      working copies, there are some limitations on how far we can
      abuse this model.</para>

    <para>From a theoretical point of view, we define <quote>revision
        5 of directory <filename>foo</filename></quote> to mean a
      specific collection of directory-entries and properties.  Now
      suppose we start adding and removing files from
      <filename>foo</filename>, and then commit.  It would be a lie
      to say that we still have revision 5 of
      <filename>foo</filename>.  However, if we bumped
      <filename>foo</filename>'s revision number after the commit,
      that would be a lie too; there may be other changes to
      <filename>foo</filename> we haven't yet received, because we
      haven't updated yet.</para>
    
    <para>Subversion deals with this problem by quietly tracking
      committed adds and deletes in the <filename>.svn</filename>
      area.  When you eventually run <command>svn update</command>,
      all accounts are settled with the repository, and the
      directory's new revision number is set correctly.
      <emphasis>Therefore, only after an update is it truly safe to
        say that you have a <quote>perfect</quote> revision of a
        directory.</emphasis> Most of the time, your working copy will
      contain <quote>imperfect</quote> directory revisions.</para>
    
    <para>Similarly, a problem arises if you attempt to commit
      property changes on a directory.  Normally, the commit would
      bump the working directory's local revision number.  But again,
      that would be a lie, because there may be adds or deletes that
      the directory doesn't yet have, because no update has happened.
      <emphasis>Therefore, you are not allowed to commit
      property-changes on a directory unless the directory is
      up-to-date.</emphasis></para>

    versioning, see <xref linkend="svn-ch-2-sect-3.4"/>.</para>

    <title>More Disconnected Operations</title>

    <para>In recent years, disk space has become outrageously cheap
      and abundant, but network bandwidth has not.  Therefore, the
      Subversion working copy has been optimized around the scarcer
      resource.</para>

    <para>The <filename>.svn</filename> administrative directory
      serves the same purpose as the <filename>CVS</filename>
      directory, except that it also stores read-only,
      <quote>pristine</quote> copies of your files.  This allows you
      to do many things off-line:</para>
    
    <variablelist>
      
      <varlistentry>
        <term><command>svn status</command></term>
        <listitem>
          <para>Shows you any local changes you've made. (see <xref
              linkend="svn-ch-3-sect-4.3.1"/>)</para>

        </listitem>
      </varlistentry>

    </variablelist>

    <para>Also, the cached pristine files allow the Subversion client
      to send differences when committing, which CVS cannot do.</para>

    <para>The last subcommand in the list is new; it will not only
      remove local mods, but it will un-schedule operations such as
      adds and deletes.  It's the preferred way to revert a file;
      running <command>rm file; svn up</command> will still work, but
      it blurs the purpose of updating.  And, while we're on this
      subject&hellip;

    <title>Distinction Between Status and Update</title>

    <para>In Subversion, we've tried to erase a lot of the confusion
      between the <command>cvs status</command> and
      <command>cvs update</command> commands.</para>

    <para>The <command>cvs status</command> command has two purposes:
      first, to show the user any local modifications in the working
      copy, and second, to show the user which files are out-of-date.
      Unfortunately, because of CVS's hard-to-read status output, many
      CVS users don't take advantage of this command at all.  Instead,
      they've developed a habit of running <command>cvs up</command>
      to quickly see their mods.  Of course, this has the side effect
      of merging repository changes that you may not be ready to deal
      with!</para>

    <para>With Subversion, we've tried to remove this muddle by making
      the output of <command>svn status</command> easy to read for
      both humans and parsers.  Also, <command>svn update</command>
      only prints information about files that are updated,
      <emphasis>not</emphasis> local modifications.</para>

    <para>Here's a quick guide to <command>svn status</command>.  We
      encourage all new Subversion users to use it early and often:</para>

    <variablelist>
      <title><command>svn status</command> prints all files that have
        local modifications; the network is not accessed by
        default.</title>
      
      <varlistentry>
        <term><option>-u</option> switch</term>
        <listitem>
          <para>Add out-of-dateness information from repository.</para>
        </listitem>
      </varlistentry>
      
      <varlistentry>
        <term><option>-v</option> switch</term>
        <listitem>
          <para>Show <emphasis>all</emphasis> entries under
            version control.</para>
        </listitem>
      </varlistentry>

      <varlistentry>
        <term><option>-n</option> switch</term>
        <listitem>
          <para>Nonrecursive.</para>
        </listitem>
      </varlistentry>

    </variablelist>

    <para>The status command has two output formats.  In the default
      <quote>short</quote> format, local modifications look like
      this:</para>

    <screen>
% svn status
M     ./foo.c
M     ./bar/baz.c
    </screen>

    <para>If you specify the <option>--update</option>
      (<option>-u</option>) switch, a longer output format is
      used:</para>

    <screen>
% svn status -u
M             1047    ./foo.c
_      *      1045    ./faces.html
_      *         -    ./bloo.png
M             1050    ./bar/baz.c
Head revision:   1066
    </screen>

    <para>In this case, two new columns appear.  The second column
      contains an asterisk if the file or directory is out-of-date.
      The third column shows the working-copy's revision number of the
      item.  In the example above, the asterisk indicates that
      <filename>faces.html</filename> would be patched if we updated,
      and that <filename>bloo.png</filename> is a newly added file in
      the repository.  (The <command>-</command> next to bloo.png
      means that it doesn't yet exist in the working copy.)</para>

    <!-- ###TODO describe -u here as well as -uv. -u and -v use
    different "long" formats and need to be documented
    separately. Moreover, as you can combine -u and -v, it needs to be
    explained what each of them does. As -u is much more important
    than -v, and the example following that paragraph *is* about -u,
    not -v, my patch concentrated on that. -->

    <para>Lastly, here's a quick summary of status codes that you may
    see:</para>

    <screen>
A    Add
D    Delete
R    Replace  (delete, then re-add)
M    local Modification
U    Updated
G    merGed
C    Conflict
    </screen>

    <para>Subversion has combined the CVS <command>P</command> and
      <command>U</command> codes into just <command>U</command>.  When
      a merge or conflict occurs, Subversion simply prints
      <command>G</command> or <command>C</command>, rather than a
      whole sentence about it.</para>

    status</command>, see <xref linkend="svn-ch-3-sect-4.3.1" />.</para>

    <title>Branches and Tags</title>

    <para>Subversion doesn't distinguish between filesystem space and
      <quote>branch</quote> space; branches and tags are ordinary
      directories within the filesystem.  This is probably the single
      biggest mental hurdle a CVS user will need to climb.  Read all

    <title>Meta-data Properties</title>

    <para>A new feature of Subversion is that you can attach arbitrary
      metadata to files and directories.  We refer to this data as
      <firstterm>properties</firstterm>, and they can be thought of as
      collections of arbitrary name/value pairs attached to each item
      in your working copy.</para>
    
    <para>To set or get a property name, use the <command>svn

  <!-- ================================================================= -->
  <sect1 id="svn-app-a-sect-7">
    <title>Conflict resolution</title>

    <para>CVS marks conflicts with in-line <quote>conflict
        markers</quote>, and prints a <command>C</command> during an
        update.  Historically, this has caused problems, because CVS
        isn't doing enough.  Many users forget about (or don't see)
        the <command>C</command> after it whizzes by on their
        terminal.  They often forget that the conflict-markers are
        even present, and then accidentally commit files containing
        conflict-markers.</para>

    <para>Subversion solves this problem by making conflicts more
      tangible.  It remembers that a file is in a state of conflict,
      and won't allow you to commit your changes until you run
      <command>svn resolve</command>.  See <xref
      linkend="svn-ch-3-sect-4.4"/> for more details.</para>
  </sect1>

  <!-- ================================================================= -->
  <sect1 id="svn-app-a-sect-8">
    <title>Binary files and translation</title>
    
    <para>CVS users have to mark binary files with
      <option>-kb</option> flags, to prevent data from being garbled
      (due to keyword expansion and line-ending translations).  They
      sometimes forget to do this.</para>

    <para>Subversion takes the more paranoid route: first, it never
      performs any kind of keyword or line-ending translation unless
      you explicitly ask it do so (see <xref
      linkend="svn-ch-6-sect-2.3.4"/> and <xref
      linkend="svn-ch-6-sect-2.3.5"/> for more details.)  By default,
      Subversion treats all file data as literal bytestrings, and
      files are always stored in the repository in an untranslated
      state.</para>

    <para>Second, Subversion maintains an internal notion of whether a
      file is <quote>text</quote> or <quote>binary</quote> data, but
      this notion is <emphasis>only</emphasis> extant in the working
      copy.  During a <command>svn update</command>, Subversion will
      perform contextual merges on locally modified text files, but
      will not attempt to do so for binary files.</para>

    <para>To determine whether a contextual merge is possible,
      Subversion examines the <literal>svn:mime-type</literal>
      property.  If the file has no <literal>svn:mime-type</literal>
      property, or has a mime-type that is textual (e.g. text/*),
      Subversion assumes it is text.  Otherwise, Subversion it assumes
      the file is binary.  Subversion also helps users by running a
      binary-detection algorithm in the <command>svn import</command>
      and <command>svn add</command> commands.  These commands will
      make a good guess and then (possibly) set a binary
      <literal>svn:mime-type</literal> property on the file being
      added.  (If Subversion guesses wrong, the user can always remove
      or hand-edit the property.)</para>

      will update the working copy appropriately.</para>
