<title>Repository Administration</title>

  <simplesect>

    <para>The Subversion repository is the central storehouse of
      versioned data for any number of projects.  As such, it becomes
      an obvious candidate for all the love and attention an
      administrator can offer.  While the repository is generally a
      low-maintenance item, it is important to understand how to
      properly configure and care for it so that potential problems
      are avoided, and actual problems safely resolved.  In this
      chapter, we'll discuss:</para>

      you should definitely pay attention to this chapter.</para>

    <title>Repository Creation and Configuration</title>

    <para>Creating a Subversion repository is incredibly simple.  The
      <command>svnadmin</command> utility, provided with Subversion,
      has a subcommand for doing just that.  To create a new
      repository, just run:</para>
          
    <screen>
$ svnadmin create path/to/repos
</screen>
          
    <para>This creates a new repository in the directory
      <filename>path/to/repos</filename>.  This new repository begins
      life at revision 0, which is defined to consist of nothing but
      the top-level root (<filename>/</filename>) filesystem
      directory.  Initially, revision 0 also has a single revision
      property, <literal>svn:date</literal>, set to the time at which
      the repository was created.</para>
          
    <para>You may have noticed that the path argument to
      <command>svnadmin</command> was just a regular filesystem path
      and not a URL like the <command>svn</command> client program
      uses when referring to repositories.  Both
      <command>svnadmin</command> and <command>svnlook</command> are
      considered server-side utilities&mdash;they are used on the
      machine where the repository resides to examine or modify
      aspects of the repository, and are in fact unable to perform
      tasks across a network.  A common mistake made by Subversion
      newcomers is trying to pass URLs (even "local"
      <literal>file:</literal> ones) to these two programs.</para>

    <para>So, after you've run the <command>svnadmin create</command>
      command, you have a shiny new Subversion repository in its own
      directory.  Let's take a peek at what is actually created inside
      that subdirectory.</para>
            
    <screen>
$ ls repos
conf/  dav/  db/  format  hooks/  locks/  README
</screen>
      
    <para>As you can see, immediately inside the repository directory
      is collection of mostly subdirectories.  As in other areas of
      the Subversion design, modularity is given high regard, and
      heirarchical organization is preferred to cluttered chaos.  The
      following is a brief description of all of those items in your
      new repository directory:</para>

    <variablelist>
      <varlistentry>
        <term>conf</term>
        <listitem>
          <para>Currently unused, repository configuration files will
            go in this directory someday.</para>

            their private housekeeping data.</para>

      </varlistentry>
     <varlistentry>
        <term>db</term>
        <listitem>
          <para>The main Berkeley DB environment, full of DB tables
            that comprise the data store for Subversion's filesystem
            (where all of your versioned data resides).</para>
        </listitem>
      </varlistentry>
     <varlistentry>
        <term>format</term>
        <listitem>
          <para>A file whose contents are a single integer value that
            dictates the version number of the repository layout.</para>
        </listitem>
      </varlistentry>
     <varlistentry>
        <term>hooks</term>
        <listitem>
          <para>A directory full of hook script templates (and hook
            scripts themselves, once you've installed some).</para>
        </listitem>
      </varlistentry>
     <varlistentry>
        <term>locks</term>
        <listitem>
          <para>A directory for Subversion's repository locking
            data, used for tracking accessors to the repository.</para>
        </listitem>

        <term>README</term>
        <listitem>
          <para>A file which merely informs its readers that they
            are looking at a Subversion repository.</para>
        </listitem>
      </varlistentry>
    </variablelist>
      
    <para>In general, you'll not want to tamper with most of the items
      in your repository, at least not <quote>by hand</quote>.  The
      <command>svnadmin</command> tool should be sufficient for any
      changes necessary to your repository, or you can look to
      third-party tools (such as Berkeley DB's tool suite) for
      tweaking relevant subsections of the repository.  Some
      exceptions exist, though, and we'll cover those here.</para>

      <title>Hook scripts</title>

      <para>A <firstterm>hook</firstterm> is a program triggered by
        some repository event, such as the creation of a new revision
        or the modification of an unversioned property.  Each hook is
        handed enough information to tell what that event is, what
        target(s) it's operating on, and the username of the person
        who triggered the event.  Depending on the hook's output or
        return status, the hook program may continue the action, stop
        it, or suspend it in some way.</para>
            
      <para>The <filename>hooks</filename> subdirectory is, by
        default, filled with templates for various repository
        hooks.</para>
            
      <screen>
$ ls repos/hooks/
post-commit.tmpl          pre-revprop-change.tmpl  write-sentinels.tmpl
post-revprop-change.tmpl  read-sentinels.tmpl
pre-commit.tmpl           start-commit.tmpl
</screen>
            
      <para>There is one template for each hook that the Subversion
        repository implements, and by examining the contents of those
        template scripts, you can see what triggers each such script
        to run and what data is passed to that script.  Also present
        in many of these templates are examples of how one might use
        that script, in conjunction with other Subversion-supplied
        programs, to perform common useful tasks.  To actually install
        a working hook, you need only place some executable program or
        script into the <filename>repos/hooks</filename> directory
        which can be execute as the name (like
        <command>start-commit</command> or
        <command>post-commit</command>) of the hook.</para>

      <para>On Unix platforms, this means supplying a script or
        program (which could be a shell script, a Python program, a
        compiled C binary, or any number of other things) named
        exactly like the name of the hook.  Of course, the template
        files are present for more than just informational
        purposes&mdash;the easiest way to install a hook on Unix
        platforms is to simply copy the appropriate template file to a
        new file that lacks the <literal>.tmpl</literal> extension,
        and then customize the hooks contents.  Windows, however, uses
        file extensions to denote executability, so you would need to
        supply a program whose basename is the name of the hook plus
        one of the special extensions recognized by Windows for
        executable programs, such as <filename>.exe</filename> or
        <filename>.com</filename> for programs, and
        <filename>.bat</filename> for batch files.</para>
          
      <para>Currently there are five true hooks implemented by the
        Subversion repository.  The following is a brief description
        of how each of those works:</para>

      <variablelist>
        <varlistentry>
          <term><filename>start-commit</filename></term>
          <listitem>
            <para>This is run before the committer's transaction is
              even created.  It is typically used to decide if the
              user has commit privileges at all.  The repository
              passes two arguments to this program:  the path to the
              repository, and username which is attempting the commit.
              If the program returns a non-zero exit value, the commit
              is stopped before the transaction is even created.</para>
          </listitem>
        </varlistentry>
            
        <varlistentry>
          <term><filename>pre-commit</filename></term>
          <listitem>
            <para>This is run when the transaction is complete, but
              before it is committed.  Typically, this hook is used to
              protect against commits that are disallowed due to
              content or location (for example, your site might
              require that all commits to a certain branch include a
              ticket number from the bug tracker, or that the incoming
              log message is non-empty).  The repository passes two
              arguments to this program: the path to the repository,
              and the name of the transaction being committed.  If the
              program returns a non-zero exit value, the commit is
              aborted and transaction is removed.</para>

            <para>The Subversion distribution includes a
              <command>commit-access-control.pl</command> script
              (located in the <filename>tools/hook-scripts</filename>
              directory of the Subversion source tree) that can be
              called from <command>pre-commit</command> to implement
              fine-grained access control.  At this time, this is the
              only method by which users can implement finer-grained
              access control beyond what
              <filename>httpd.conf</filename> offers.  In a future
              version of Subversion, we plan to implement ACLs
              directly in the filesystem.</para>
          </listitem>
        </varlistentry>

        <varlistentry>
          <term><filename>post-commit</filename></term>
          <listitem>
            <para>This is run after the transaction is committed, and
              a new revision is created.  Most people use this hook to
              send out descriptive emails about the commit or to make
              a perform a backup of the repository.  The repository
              passes two arguments to this program: the path to the
              repository, and the new revision number that was
              created.  The exit code of the program is ignored.</para>
                
            <para>The Subversion distribution includes a
              <command>commit-email.pl</command> script (located in
              the <filename>tools/hook-scripts/</filename> directory
              of the Subversion source tree) that can be used to send
              email with (and/or append to a log file) a description
              of a given commit.  This mail contains a list of the
              paths that were changed, the log message attached to the
              commit, the author and date of the commit, as well as a
              GNU diff-style display of the changes made to the
              various versioned files as part of the commit.</para>

            <para>Another useful tool provided by Subversion is the
              <command>hot-backup.py</command> script (located in the
              <filename>tools/backup/</filename> directory of the
              Subversion source tree).  This script performs hot
              backups of your Subversion repository (a feature
              supported by the Berkeley DB database backend), and can
              be used to make a per-commit snapshot of your repository
              for archival or emergency recovery purposes.</para>
          </listitem>
        </varlistentry>

        <varlistentry>
          <term><filename>pre-revprop-change</filename></term>
          <listitem>
            <para>Because Subversion's revision properties are not
              versioned, making modifications to such a property (for
              example, the <literal>svn:log</literal> commit message
              property) will overwrite the previous value of that
              property forever.  Since data can be potentially lost
              here, Subversion supplies this hook (and its
              counterpart, <filename>post-revprop-change</filename>)
              so that repository administrators can keep records of
              changes to these items using some externals means if
              they so desire.</para>

            <para>This hook runs just before such a modification is
              made to the repository.  The repository passes four
              arguments to this hook: the path to the repository, the
              revision on which the to-be-modied property exist, the
              authenticated username of the person making the change,
              and name of the property itself.</para>
          </listitem>
        </varlistentry>

        <varlistentry>
          <term><filename>pre-revprop-change</filename></term>
          <listitem>
            <para>As mentioned earlier, this hook is the counterpart
              of <filename>pre-revprop-change</filename> hook.  In
              fact, for the sake of paranoia this script will not run
              unless the <filename>pre-revprop-change</filename> hook
              exists.  When both of these hooks are present, the
              <filename>post-revprop-change</filename> hook runs just
              after a revision property has been changed, and is
              typically used to send an email containing the new value
              of the changed property.  The repository passes four
              arguments to this hook: the path to the repository, the
              revision on which the property exists, the authenticated
              username of the person making the change, and name of
              the property itself.</para>

            <para>The Subversion distribution includes a
              <command>propchange-email.pl</command> script (located
              in the <filename>tools/hook-scripts/</filename>
              directory of the Subversion source tree) that can be
              used to send email with (and/or append to a log file)
              the details of a revision property change.  This mail
              contains the revision and name of the changed property,
              the user who made the change, and the new property
              value.</para>
          </listitem>
        </varlistentry>
      </variablelist>

      <sidebar>
        <title>Sentinels, Those <quote>Other</quote> Hooks</title>

        <para>In addition to the hook scripts, Subversion has
          templates for two other special event handlers&mdash;the
          <filename>read-sentinels</filename> and
          <filename>write-sentinels</filename>.  These special
          programs, called <firstterm>sentinels</firstterm>, are
          intended to be daemon-like applications which are started at
          the beginning of a user's operation, and which receive
          multiple event notifications of a single type over the
          course of that operation.  Depending on the sentinel's
          responses to each of these notifications, Subversion may
          stop or otherwise modify the operation.  Fortunately for
          today's Subversion repository administrators, these
          sentinels can be ignored, since support for them is not yet
          implemented in Subversion itself!</para>
      </sidebar>
            
      <para>Subversion will attempt to execute hooks as the same user
        who owns the Subversion repository process.  In most cases,
        the repository is being access via Apache HTTP server and
        mod_dav_svn, so this user is the same user that Apache runs
        as.  The hooks themselves will need to be configured with
        OS-level permissions that allow that user to execute them.
        Also, this means that any file or programs (including the
        Subversion repository itself) accessed directly or indirectly
        by the hook will be accessed as the same user.  In other
        words, be alert to potential permissioning problems that might
        keep the hook from performing the tasks you've written it to
        perform.</para>

      <title>Berkeley DB configuration</title>

      <para>The Berkeley DB environment has it own set of default
        configuration values for things like the number of lock
        allowed to be taken out at any given time, or the size
        cutoff for Berkeley's journaling log file, etc.
        Subversion's filesystem code additional chooses default
        values for some of the Berkeley DB configuration options.
        However, sometimes your particular repository, with its
        unique collection of data and access patterns, might require
        a different set of configuration option values.</para>

     <para>The folks at Sleepycat (the producers of Berkeley DB)
        understand that different databases have different
        requirements, and so have provided a mechanism for runtime
        overriding of many of the configuration values for the
        Berkeley DB environment.  Berkeley checks for the presence
        of a file named <filename>DB_CONFIG</filename> in each
        environment directory, and parses the options found in that
        file for use with that particular Berkeley
        environment.</para>

     <para>The Berkeley configuration overrides file for your
        repository is located in the <filename>db</filename>
        environment directory, at
        <filename>repos/db/DB_CONFIG</filename>.  Subversion itself
        creates this file when it creates the rest the repository.
        The file initially contains some default options, as well as
        pointers to the Berkeley DB online documentation so you can
        read about what those options do.  Of course, you are free to
        add any of the supported Berkeley DB options to your
        <filename>DB_CONFIG</filename> file.  Just be aware that while
        Subversion never attempts to read or interpret the contents of
        the file, and makes no use of the option settings in it,
        you'll want to avoid any configuration changes that may cause
        BerkeleyDB to behave in a fashion that is unexpected by the
        rest of the Subversion code.</para>

          doing a commit, a client builds a Subversion transaction
          that mirrors their local changes (plus any additional
          changes that might have been made to the repository since
          the beginning of the client's commit process), and then
          instructs the repository to store that tree as the next
          snapshot in the sequence.  If the commit succeeds, the
          transaction is effectively promoted into a new revision
          tree, and is assigned a new revision number.  If the commit
          fails for some reason, the transaction is destroyed and the
          client is informed of the failure.</para>
            
        <para>At the moment, updates work in a similar way.  The
          client builds a temporary transaction tree that mimics the
          state of the working copy.  The repository then compares
          that transaction tree with the revision tree at the request
          revision (usually the most recent, or
          <quote>youngest</quote> tree), and sends back information
          that informs the client about what changes are needed to
          transform their working copy into a replica of that revision
          tree.  After the update completes, the temporary transaction
          is deleted.</para>
            
        <para>The use of transaction trees is the only way to make
          permanent changes to repository's versioned filesystem.
          However, it's important to understand that the lifetime of a
          transaction is completely flexible.  In the case of updates,
          transactions are temporary trees that are immediately
          destroyed.  In the case of commits, transactions are
          transformed into permanent revisions (or aborted if the
          commit fails).  In the case of an error or bug, it's
          possible that a transaction can be accidentally left lying
          around in the repository (not really affecting anything, but
          still taking up space).</para>

        <para>In theory, someday whole workflow applications might
          revolve around more fine-grained control of transaction
          lifetime.  It is feasible to imagine a system whereby each
          transaction slated to become a revision is left in statis
          well after the client finishes describing its changes to
          repository.  This would enable each new commit to be
          reviewed by someone else, perhaps a manager or engineering
          QA team, who can choose to promote the transaction into a
          revision, or abort it.</para>
            
        <para>You might at this point be wondering what all of this
          has to do with repository administration.  The answer is
          simple: if you're administering a Subversion repository,
          you're going to have to examine revisions and transactions.
          It's part of monitoring the health of, and tracking changes
          to, your repository.</para>

        <title>svnlook</title>
            
        <para><command>svnlook</command> is a tool provided by
          Subversion for examining the various revisions and
          transaction in a repository.  No part of this program
          attempts to change the repository&mdash;it a
          <quote>read-only</quote> tool.  <command>svnlook</command>
          is the typically used by the repository hooks for reporting
          the changes that are about to be committed (in the case of
          the <command>pre-commit</command> hook) or that were just
          committed (in the case of the <command>post-commit</command>
          hook) to the repository.  Also, a repository administrator
          may find himself using this tool for diagnostic
          purposes.</para>
            
        <para><command>svnlook</command> has a straightforward
          syntax:</para>
            
        <screen>
$ svnlook help
general usage: svnlook SUBCOMMAND REPOS_PATH [ARGS &amp; OPTIONS ...]
Note: any subcommand which takes the '--revision' and '--transaction'
      options will, if invoked without one of those options, act on
      the repository's youngest revision.
Type "svnlook help &lt;subcommand&gt;" for help on a specific subcommand.
...
</screen>

        <para>Nearly every one of <command>svnlook</command>'s
          subcommand can operate on either a revision or a
          transacation tree, printing information about the tree
          itself, or how it differs from the previous revision of the
          repository.  You use the <option>--revision</option> and
          <option>--transaction</option> options to specify which
          revision or transaction, respectively, to examine.  Note
          that while revision numbers appear as natural numbers,
          transaction names are alphanumeric strings.  In the absence
          of both of these options, <command>svnlook</command> will
          examine the youngest (or <quote>HEAD</quote>) revision in
          the repository.  So the following two commands do exactly
          the same thing when 19 is the youngest revision in
          <filename>/path/to/repos</filename>:</para>

        <screen>
$ svnlook info /path/to/repos
$ svnlook info /path/to/repos --revision 19
</screen>

        <para>The only exception to these rules about subcommands is
          the <command>svnlook youngest</command> subcommand, which
          takes no options, and simply prints out that HEAD revision
          number.</para>

        <screen>
$ svnlook youngest /path/to/repos

</screen>
            
        <para>Output from <command>svnlook</command> is designed to be
          both human- and machine-parsable.  Take as an example the output
          of the <literal>info</literal> subcommand:</para>

Greek tree.
</screen>

        <para>The output of the <literal>info</literal> subcommand is
          defined as:</para>

        <orderedlist>
          <listitem>
            <para>The author, followed by a newline.</para>
          </listitem>
          <listitem>
            <para>The date, followed by a newline.</para>
          </listitem>
          <listitem>
            <para>The number of characters in the log message,
              followed by a newline.</para>
          </listitem>
          <listitem>
            <para>The log message itself, followed by a newline.</para>
          </listitem>
        </orderedlist>

        <para>This output is human-readable, meaning items like the
          datestamp are displayed using a textual representation
          instead of something more obscure (such as the number of
          nanoseconds since the Tasty Freeze guy drove by).  But this
          output is also machine-parsable&mdash;because the log
          message can contain multiple lines and be unbounded in
          length, <command>svnlook</command> provides the length of
          that message before the message itself so scripts and other
          wrappers around this command can make intelligent decisions
          about the log message, such as how much memory to allocate
          for the message, or at least how many bytes to skip in the
          event that this output is not the last bit of data in the
          stream.</para>

        <para>Another common use of <command>svnlook</command> is to
          actually view the contents of a revision or transaction
          tree.  Examining the output of <command>svnlook
          tree</command> command, which displays the directories and
          files in the requested tree (optionally showing the
          filesystem node revision IDs for each of those paths) can be
          extremely helpful to administrators deciding on whether or
          not it is safe to remove a seemingly dead transaction.  It
          is also quite useful for Subversion developers who are
          diagnosing filesystem-related problems when they
          arise.</para>

      <title>Berkeley DB Management</title>
            
      <para>Currently, the Subversion repository has only one database
        back-end: Berkeley DB.  All of your filesystem's structure and
        data live in a set of tables within the
        <filename>db</filename> subdirectory of your repository.  This
        subdirectory is a regular Berkeley DB environment directory,
        and can therefore be used in conjunction with any of
        Berkeley's database tools (you can see the documentation for
        these tools at SleepyCat's website, <systemitem
        class="url">http://www.sleepycat.com/</systemitem>).  For
        day-to-day Subversion use, these tools should be unnecessary,
        however, they do provide some important functionality that is
        currently not provided by Subversion itself.</para>

      <para>Remember that Berkeley DB has genuine transactions.
        Every attempt to change the DB is first logged.  If anything
        ever goes wrong, the DB can back itself up to a previous
        <literal>checkpoint</literal> and replay transactions to get
        the data back into a sane state.</para>
            
      <para>In our experience, we have seen situations where a bug in
        Subversion (which causes a crash) can sometimes have a
        side-effect of leaving the DB environment in a
        <quote>locked</quote> state.  When the repository is in this
        state, any attempts to read or write to the repository stall
        indefinitely as Subversion awaits the release of a lock that
        cannot be released.  Fortunately, Berkeley DB has genuine
        support for transactions, and Subversion takes advantage of
        that.  This means that every change to the database is first
        logged, and then exacted, so that if anyone goes wrong, the
        database can revert back to a previous
        <quote>checkpoint</quote> and replay the transactions to get
        back into a sane state.</para>

        root in the <filename>db</filename> directory, which the
        non-root user that manages the database cannot open.  If you
        do this, you'll get <quote>permission denied</quote> error
        messages when you try to access the repository.</para><!--
        ###TODO Make this a warning block? -Fitz -->
      
      <para>Second, a repository administrator may need to manage
        the growth of logfiles.  At any given time, the DB
        environment is using at least one logfile to log
        transactions; when the <quote>current</quote> logfile grows
        to 10 megabytes, a new logfile is started, and the old one
        continues to exist.</para>
          
      <para>Thus, after a while, you may see a whole group of 1MB
        logfiles lying around the environment.  At this point, you
        can make a choice: if you leave every single logfile behind,
        it's guaranteed that <command>db_recover</command> will
        always be able to replay every single DB transaction, all
        the way back to the first commit.  (This is the
        <quote>safe</quote>, or perhaps paranoid, route.)  On the
        other hand, you can ask Berkeley DB to tell you which
        logfiles are no longer being actively written to:</para>
          
      <screen>
$ db_archive -a -h repos/db
log.0000000023
log.0000000024
log.0000000029
</screen>
            
      <para>Subversion's own repository uses a
        <literal>post-commit</literal> hook script, which, after
        performing a <quote>hot-backup</quote> of the repository,
        removes these excess logfiles.  (In the Subversion source
        tree, see
        <filename>tools/backup/hot-backup.py</filename>).</para>
          
      <para>This script also illustrates the safe way to perform a
        backup of the repository while it's still up and running:
        recursively copy the entire repository directory, then
        re-copy the logfiles listed by <command>db_archive
        -l</command>.</para>
          
      <para>To start using a repository backup that you've restored,
        be sure to run <command>db_recover -v</command> command in
        the <filename>db</filename> area first.  This guarantees
        that any unfinished log transactions are fully played before
        the repository goes live again.  (The
        <command>hot-backup.py</command> script does that for you
        during backup, so you can skip this step if you decide to
        use it.)</para>
          
      <para>Finally, note that Berkeley DB has a whole locking
        subsystem; in extremely intensive svn operations, we have seen
        situations where the DB environment runs out of locks.  The
        maximum number of locks can be adjusted by changing the values
        in the <filename>repos/db/DB_CONFIG</filename> file.  Don't
        change the default values unless you know what you're doing;
        be sure to read <systemitem
        class="url">http://www.sleepycat.com/docs/ref/lock/max.html</systemitem>

      <title>Tweaking with Svnadmin</title>
            
      <para>The <command>svnadmin</command> tool has some
        subcommands that are specifically useful to repository
        administrators.  Be careful with the
        <command>svnadmin</command>!  Unlike
        <command>svnlook</command>, which is read-only,
        <command>svnadmin</command> has the ability to modify the
        repository.</para>
          
      <para>The most-used feature is probably <literal>svnadmin
        setlog</literal>.  A commit's log message is an unversioned
        property directly attached to the revision object; there's
        only one log message per revision.  Sometimes a user screws
        up the message, and it needs to be replaced:</para>
          
      <screen>
$ echo "Here is the new, correct log message" > newlog.txt
$ svnadmin setlog myrepos 388 newlog.txt
</screen>
            
      <para>There's a nice CGI script in
        <filename>tools/cgi/</filename> that allows people (with
        commit-access passwords) to tweak existing log messages via
        web browser.</para>
          
      <para>Another common use of <command>svnadmin</command> is to
        inspect and clean up old, dead transactions.  Commits and
        updates both create transaction trees, but occasionally a
        bug or crash can leave them lying around.  By inspecting the
        datestamp on a transaction, an administrator can make a
        judgment call and remove it:</para>
          
      <screen>

      <!-- ###TODO Hey guys, are going to continue to support

      <para>Another useful subcommand: <command>svnadmin
        undeltify</command>.  Remember that the latest version of
        each file is stored as fulltext in the repository, but that
        earlier revisions of files are stored as
        <quote>deltas</quote> against each next-most-recent
        revisions.  When a user attempts to access an earlier
        revision, the repository must apply a sequence of
        backwards-deltas to the newest fulltexts in order to derive
        the older data.</para>
          
      <para>If a particular revision tree is extremely popular, the
        administrator can speed up the access time to this tree by
        <quote>undeltifying</quote> any path within the
        revision&mdash; that is, by converting every file to
        fulltext:</para>

      <title>Migrating a repository</title>
    
      <para>Sometimes special situations arise where you need to move
        all of your filesystem data from one repository to another.
        Perhaps the internal fs database schema has changed in some way
        in a new release of Subversion, or perhaps you'd like to start
        using a different database <quote>back end</quote>.</para>
  
      <para>Either way, your data needs to be migrated to a new
        repository.  To do this, we have the <command>svnadmin dump</command> and
        <command>svnadmin load</command> commands.</para>
  
      <para><command>svnadmin dump</command> writes a stream of your
        repository's data to stdout:</para>
  
      <screen>
$ svnadmin dump myrepos > dumpfile
* Dumped revision 0.
* Dumped revision 1.
* Dumped revision 2.
&hellip;
</screen>

      <para>This stream describes every revision in your repository as a
        list of changes to nodes.  It's mostly human-readable text; but
        when a file's contents change, the entire fulltext is dumped
        into the stream.  If you have binary files or binary
        property-values in your repository, those parts of the stream
        may be unfriendly to human readers.</para>
  
      <para>After dumping your data, you would then move the file to a
        different system (or somehow alter the environment to use a
        different version of <command>svnadmin</command> and/or
        <filename>libsvn_fs.so</filename>), and create a
        <quote>new</quote>-style repository that has a new schema or DB
        back-end:</para>
  
      <screen>
$ svnadmin create newrepos
</screen>
    
      <para>The <command>svnadmin load</command> command attempts to
        read a dumpstream from stdin, and effectively replays each
        commit:</para>
  
      <screen>
$ svnadmin load newrepos &lt; dumpfile
&lt;&lt;&lt; Started new txn, based on original revision 1
     * adding path : A ... done.
     * adding path : A/B ... done.
&hellip;
------- Committed new rev 1 (loaded from original rev 1) &gt;&gt;&gt;

&lt;&lt;&lt; Started new txn, based on original revision 2
     * editing path : A/mu ... done.
     * editing path : A/D/G/rho ... done.

------- Committed new rev 2 (loaded from original rev 2) &gt;&gt;&gt;
</screen>

      <para>Voila, your revisions have been recommitted into the new
        repository.</para>
      
      <para>And because <command>svnadmin</command> uses standard input
        and output streams for the repository dump and load process,
        people who are feeling saucy with Unix can try things like
        this:</para>
  
      <screen>
$ svnadmin create newrepos
$ svnadmin dump myrepos | svnadmin load newrepos
</screen>

      <para>You can also create a dumpfile that represents a specific
        range of revisions.  <command>svnadmin dump</command> takes
        optional starting and ending revisions to accomplish just that
        task.</para>

      <screen>
$ svnadmin dump myrepos 23 > rev-23.dumpfile
$ svnadmin dump myrepos 100 200 > revs-100-200.dumpfile
</screen>

      <para>Now, regardless of the range of revisions used when
        dumping the repository, the default behavior is for the first
        revision dumped to always be compared against revision 0,
        which is just the empty root directory <filename>/</filename>.
        This means that the first revision in any dumpfile will always
        look like a gigantic list of <quote>added</quote> nodes.  We
        do this so that a file like
        <filename>revs-100-200.dumpfile</filename> can be directly
        loaded into an empty repository.</para>

      <para>However, if you add the <option>--incremental</option>
        option when you dump your repository, this tells
        <command>svnadmin</command> to compare the first dumped
        revision against the previous revision in the repository, the
        same way it treats every other revision that gets dumped.  The
        benefit of this is that you can create several small dumpfiles
        that can be loaded in succession, instead of one large one,
        like so:</para>

      <screen>
$ svnadmin dump myrepos 0 1000 > dumpfile1
$ svnadmin dump myrepos 1001 2000 --incremental > dumpfile2
$ svnadmin dump myrepos 2001 3000 --incremental > dumpfile3
</screen>

      <para>These dumpfiles could be loaded into a new repository with
        the following command sequence:</para>

      <screen>
$ svnadmin load newrepos &lt; dumpfile1
$ svnadmin load newrepos &lt; dumpfile2
$ svnadmin load newrepos &lt; dumpfile3
</screen>

      <para>Another neat trick you can perform with this
        <option>--incremental</option> option involves appending to an
        existing dumpfile a new range of revisions.  For example, you
        might have a post-commit hook that simply appends the
        repository dump of the single revision that triggered the
        hook.  Or you might have a script like the following that runs
        nightly to append dumpfile data for all the revisions that
        were added to the repository since the last time the script
        ran.</para>

      <screen>
#!/usr/bin/perl

$repos_path  = '/path/to/repos';
$dumpfile    = '/usr/backup/svn-dumpfile';
$last_dumped = '/var/log/svn-last-dumped';
 
# Figure out the starting revision (0 if we cannot read the last-dumped file,
# else use the revision in that file incremented by 1).
if (open LASTDUMPED, "$last_dumped")
{
    $new_start = &lt;LASTDUMPED&gt;;
    chomp $new_start;
    $new_start++;
    close LASTDUMPED;
}
else
{
    $new_start = 0;
}

# Query the youngest revision in the repos.
$youngest = `svnlook youngest $repos_path`;
chomp $youngest;

# Do the backup.
`svnadmin dump $repos_path $new_start $youngest --incremental >> $dumpfile`;

# Store a new last-dumped revision
open LASTDUMPED, "> $last_dumped" or die;
print LASTDUMPED "$youngest\n";
close LASTDUMPED;

# All done!
</screen>

      <para>As you can see, the Subversion repository dumpfile format,
        and specifically <command>svnadmin</command>'s use of that
        format, can be a valuable means by which to backup changes to
        your repository over time in case of a system crash or some
        other catastrophic event.</para>

      permission to read and write the Berkeley DB files!  This is a

    <para>You can see all of mod_dav_svn's complaints in the Apache

    <para>Once your repository is created and configured, all that
      remains is to begin using it.  If you have a collection of
      existing data that is ready to be placed under version control,
      you will more than likely want to use the <command>svn</command>
      client program's <literal>import</literal> subcommand to get to
      accomplish that.  Before doing this, though, you should
      carefully consider your long-term plans for the repository.  In
      this section, we will offer some advice on how to plan the
      layout of your repository, and how to get your data arranged in
      that layout.</para>

      <para>While Subversion allows you to move around versioned files
        and directories without any loss of information, doing so can
        still disrupt the workflow of those who access the repository
        often and come to expect things to be at certain locations.
        Try to peer into the future a bit; plan ahead before placing
        your data under version control.  By <quote>laying out</quote>
        the contents of your repository in an effective manner the
        first time, you can prevent a load of future headaches.</para>

            joke.  It's no more about 'svn import' than it is about
            'svn mkdir' or 'svn smackdown -cage-match'.  -->

      <para>You may want to give your repository an initial directory
        structure that reflects the trunk, branches, and tags of your
        project(s) (See <xref linkend="svn-ch-4"/>.)  You can do this
        via <command>svn mkdir</command>:</para>
            
      <screen>
$ svnadmin create /path/to/repos
$ svn mkdir file:///path/to/repos/projectA -m 'Base dir for A'
Committed revision 1.
            
$ svn mkdir file:///path/to/repos/projectA/trunk -m 'Main dir for A'
Committed revision 2.
            
$ svn mkdir file:///path/to/repos/projectA/branches -m 'Branches for A'
Committed revision 3.
            
$ svn mkdir file:///path/to/repos/projectA/tags -m 'Tags for A'
Committed revision 4.
            
$ svn co file:///path/to/repos/projectA/trunk projectA
Checked out revision 4.
             
# ... now work on projectA ...
</screen>
          
      <para>With <command>svn import</command>, you can create the
        structure with a single commit:</para>
            
      <screen>
$ svnadmin create /path/to/repos
$ mkdir projectA
$ mkdir projectA/trunk
$ mkdir projectA/branches
$ mkdir projectA/tags    
$ svn import file:///path/to/repos projectA projectA -m 'Dir layout for A'
Adding         projectA/trunk
Adding         projectA/branches
Adding         projectA/tags
Committed revision 1.

$ rm -rf projectA/
$ svn co file:///path/to/repos/projectA/trunk projectA
Checked out revision 1.
