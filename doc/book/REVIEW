Chapter 3

        #1) ghudson (also affects ch 9 a little bit)

            The new date parser requires a change to the doc formats.
            A minimal patch can be found in issue #408.

            The new date parser accepts three varieties kinds of
	    formats.  The first is very nicely documented by the W3C
	    in <http://www.w3.org/TR/NOTE-datetime>; we allow the time
	    zone designator to be missing, in which case we use system
	    local time.  The second variety is just like the first
	    variety, except the punctuation characters '-' and ':' are
	    omitted.  The third variety is what we use in the output
	    of "svn log", and can look like:

              YYYY-MM-DD hh:mm[:ss[.uuuuuu]][ +hh[:mm]]

            There can be fewer than six digits in the microseconds
	    designation, and of course the time zone designation may
	    be "-hh[:mm]" instead of "+hh[:mm]".

Chapter 5

    Section svn-ch-5-sect-2.1

            There is this paragraph

            <para>Currently there are five true hooks implemented by the
            Subversion repository:</para>

            My question is, what makes a hook considered a "true" hook?

    Section svn-ch-5-sect-3.1.1

            I think this section on svnlook tree requires more
            explanation of what is being printed, what is a node
            revision ID, etc.  It makes statements on how it can be
            helpful to administrators but doesn't say how.  It also
            doesn't say how to decide if a dead transaction is really
            dead.  I suggest either removing it entirely, increasing
            the description substantially, or least preferably, just
            linking to an external document that explains this in
            greater detail, but that's not really appropriate for a
            book, it it then :)

    Section svn-ch-5-sect-6

        #1) Blair

            I don't know if the "Adding Projects" sections works best
            here.  It follows pretty specific information on setting
            up a repository, debugging, recovering, which are highly
            specific and not generally used.  This section could be
            missed.  This information is also used by people who
            aren't Subversion "administrator's".  For example, at my
            work, there are people creating new projects pretty
            consistently and we have 61 projects.  While I'm the
            administrator, the users and programmers also need to know
            project layout information.

            There's a repository layout section in chapter 4 that this
            could well be merged into.  If that doesn't work, I would
            consider moving it up to the front of this chapter.

Chapter 6

    Section svn-ch-6-sect-4

        #1) Blair

            In this sentence:

                The result is a standardized,
                robust system that is conveniently packaged as part of the
                Apache 2.0 software, is supported by numerous pieces of core
                operating system and third-party products, and which doesn't
                require network administrators to open up yet another custom
                port.

            What does this mean "is supported by numerous pieces of
            core operating system ... products"?  It would seem that
            Apache supports running on these OSes.

            Maybe changing it to read "is supported by numerous
            operating systems and third-party products, and which ..." 
            makes more sense.
