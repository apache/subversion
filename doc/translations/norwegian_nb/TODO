This is a -*- text -*- file.


--------------------------------------------------------------

Put in best-practices doc:

  - (perhaps) suggest the use of environment variables to represent
    long repository URLs.  useful for lots of branching/tagging commands.
    Maybe this can go into our existing best-practices doc?



To be fixed by someone:

  - When using shared working copies, a user changing the permissions
    of a file directly (svn ps svn:executable) or indirectly
    (i.e. through an update), must own that file.  There is no way to
    do this automatically which does not involve possible data loss.

  - ch06 talks about Basic authentication and recommends https.
    Add a mention of Digest authentication now that Apache's bug
    has been fixed that broke it and potentially update the 
    example to use it instead.

  - we seem to inconsistently assume repositories live either in
    /usr/local/svn/ or /usr/local/repositories/ throughout the book.
    We ought to consistify.

  - Use either 'use case' or 'use-case', not a mixture of both.

To be fixed by cmpilato:

   - vendor branch section needs re-working.  again.  specifically,
     note the "replacing 1.0 with 1.1 and 'missing files' stuff (files
     not overwritten by a tarball explode wouldn't be missing, they'd
     be untouched).

   - document the --ignore-externals option (added 'update',
     'checkout', 'export', and 'status').  Don't forget the reference
     section.

   - document the --use-[pre|post]-commit-hook option to 'svnadmin
     load'.  Don't forget the reference section.

--------------------------------------------------------------

To be fixed by sussman:

ch04:

   - need a giant warning-box about how our lack of 'true renames' can
     be really irritating when doing merges.  The classic case is when
     branchA moves things around, and branch B just changes file text.
     When you merge branchA into branchB, you deleting the newer file
     versions and adding-with-history the older file versions.
     Definitely a big 'gotcha' to watch out for.

   - "common use-cases for merging" shows -r405:HEAD.  let's not
     encourage HEAD, since that can be a dangerous practice.  should
     explain *why* we're not using head.


ch06:  

   -  svnserve->set access controls->last paragraph:
       Don't just mention svnserve for path-based access;
       mention the pre-commit hooks for at controlling path-based write.

   - explain shortcoming in http checkout authorization.  because
     checkout is done as one http request, there's only one chance to
     authenticate (or not).  if root-dir is anonymously readable, then
     *whole tree* will be checked out anonymously.  if root-dir
     requires authn, then *whole tree* will be checked out as that
     user.  until we get pipelining and do checkouts as multiple GETs,
     it's impossible to change authn halfway through a checkout.


appA:

   - explain why 'svn commit; svn log' won't show the commit.

List of 1.1 features/changes (that still need to be documented)
============================

  * Need whole new section to explain "peg objects" and history
    tracing.  Lots of examples involving different subcommands.
    (Which chapter should this section go in?)

  * Need whole new section explaining activating l10n and IRI autoescaping.
    (What chapter should this section go in?)

  * New 'SVNPathAuthz Off' directive, to disable path-based authz in
    apache (and increase speed.)  Really, chapter 9 needs a
    'definitive list' of all mod_dav_svn directives.

  - With svn 1.1, it's now possible to set up svn+ssh using just one
    Unix account on the server.  The book should perhaps document this
    way of setting up svn+ssh.  See notes/ssh-tricks for details.



List of 1.2 features/changes (that still need to be documented)
============================

  * svn log --limit
  * Fixed length keywords
    The format of fixed length keyword and its data is
    - Unexpanded keyword:         "$keyword::       $"
    - Expanded keyword:           "$keyword:: value $"
    - Expanded kw with filling:   "$keyword:: value   $"
    - Truncated keyword:          "$keyword:: longval#$"
  * New revprop hook features (ch05)
    - Added fifth ACTION argument (A, M, or D)
    - New/old revprop value available on stdin
