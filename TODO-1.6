We are getting close to creating the 1.6.x branch.  This file lists the tasks
we want to complete before branching.  "Blocker" tasks must be done before we
branch, while "optional" tasks would be nice to have completed, but aren't
essential.

Tasks which need to happen before the 1.6.0 release, but aren't related to when
we branch should be put in the issue tracker with the 1.6 milestone.

Blocker:

Optional:

 * Merge the sparse-directories deselection branch, as noted by kfogel:
   http://svn.haxx.se/dev/archive-2008-10/1001.shtml

 * Secure certificate passphrase caching on Windows, to bring it upto the
   same level as the other password stores. (Issue 2489)
