This branch is for development of Shelving and Checkpointing.

Specifically, this branch is for Checkpointing backed by a series of patches
stored within the WC, referred to as design "option 1" in [1].

Branch type: dev branch off trunk; updated by full merges from trunk.

Initially this is prototyping, to explore the general shape of the design and
user interface. As such, it does not take care over details of APIs and error
handling and so on.
