              CMake build system
--------------------------------

This branch exists for introducing CMake build system to Subversion. This
would done by adding a generator for the CMake files, based on the
'build.conf' file.

This was discussed on dev@ mailing list and archived at [1].


                      How to use
--------------------------------

```
# Run gen-make.py to generate the CMake files.
$ ./gen-make.py -t cmake

# Configure CMake cache. CMAKE_PREFIX_PATH is a directory, where the
# dependencies are installed in. You may pass any additional options
# to the configure command.
$ cmake -B out -DCMAKE_PREFIX_PATH=/path/to/deps

# Finally, build!
$ cmake --build out
```
