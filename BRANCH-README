This branch (^/subversion/branches/better-pristines) will be used to
implement two dependent features:

Client support for multiple working copy versions
-------------------------------------------------

Currently the working copy code can use exactly one WC version at a
time. This limitation is a problem for users who, for one reason or
another, have to use multiple client versions at the same time. The
fact that 1.8.x and 1.9.x use the same WC version was a boon to such
users, and there's no good reason that the WC implementation couldn't
have some leeway.

To this end, we'll introduce the concept of "supported version" to the
working copy. This is the minimum WC format supported by a particular
client. By default, the client will create new working copies with the
latest format[*], but will support a small range of older versions as
well.

The client should be able to not only use but also create working
copies in an older, non-current format. To this end, certain client
commands will get a new option, "--compatible-version", which behaves
analogously to the option in "svnadmin create".

For example:

    svn checkout --compatible-version=1.8

will create a new working copy with format 31. However,

    svn checkout --compatible-version=1.7

will fail, because we (currently) do not support 1.7 working copies in
newer clients.

Analogously,

    svn upgrade --compatible-version=1.9

will upgrade an older working copy to format 31.

The "svn --version" command will display a list of compatible working
copy versions.

OPTIONAL: The "svn upgrade" command may grow an option to only show
          the current and target working copy versions.


[*] New externals working copies must inherit the format from their
   parent working copy, because mixed-format working copies are a) a
   Bad Thing, and b) defeat the purpose of this feature, which is
   support for multiple versions of the client in the same working
   copy.


Compressed pristines and in-database pristine storage
-----------------------------------------------------

WC format 32 will get support for storing (small) pristine files
directly in the WC-DB as blobs in the PRISTINES table, and also for
compressing pristines with LZ4.

The current WC format 31 will remain fully supported.

The 'svn cleanup' command will grow a new option:

    svn cleanup --compress-pristines

that will, if compressed pristines are supported by the working copy
format, compress any uncompressed pristine files, possibly removing
them and storing their contents in the working copy database.

Upgdading to format 32 will _not_ automatically compress pristines.
