log: Show the log messages for a set of revision(s) and/or file(s).
usage: 1. log [PATH]
       2. log URL[@REV] [PATH...]

  1. Print the log messages for a local PATH (default: '.').
     The default revision range is BASE:1.

  2. Print the log messages for the PATHs (default: '.') under URL.
     If specified, REV determines in which revision the URL is first
     looked up.  The default revision range is HEAD:1.

  With -v, also print all affected paths with each log message.
  With -q, don't print the log message body itself (note that this is
  compatible with -v).

  Each log message is printed just once, even if more than one of the
  affected paths for that revision were explicitly requested.  Logs
  follow copy history by default.  Use --stop-on-copy to disable this
  behavior, which can be useful for determining branchpoints.

  Examples:
    svn log
    svn log foo.c
    svn log http://www.example.com/repo/project/foo.c
    svn log http://www.example.com/repo/project foo.c bar.c

Valid options:
  -r [--revision] arg      : ARG (some commands also take ARG1:ARG2 range)
                             A revision argument can be one of:
                                NUMBER       revision number
                                '{' DATE '}' revision at start of the date
                                'HEAD'       latest in repository
                                'BASE'       base rev of item's working copy
                                'COMMITTED'  last commit at or before BASE
                                'PREV'       revision just before COMMITTED
  -q [--quiet]             : print as little as possible
  -v [--verbose]           : print extra information
  --targets arg            : pass contents of file ARG as additional args
  --stop-on-copy           : do not cross copies while traversing history
  --incremental            : give output suitable for concatenation
  --xml                    : output in XML
  --username arg           : specify a username ARG
  --password arg           : specify a password ARG
  --no-auth-cache          : do not cache authentication tokens
  --non-interactive        : do no interactive prompting
  --config-dir arg         : read user configuration files from directory ARG
  --limit arg              : maximum number of log entries

switch (sw): Update the working copy to a different URL.
usage: 1. switch URL [PATH]
       2. switch --relocate FROM TO [PATH...]

  1. Update the working copy to mirror a new URL within the repository.
     This behaviour is similar to 'svn update', and is the way to
     move a working copy to a branch or tag within the same repository.

  2. Rewrite working copy URL metadata to reflect a syntactic change only.
     This is used when repository's root URL changes (such as a scheme
     or hostname change) but your working copy still reflects the same
     directory within the same repository.

Valid options:
  -r [--revision] arg      : ARG (some commands also take ARG1:ARG2 range)
                             A revision argument can be one of:
                                NUMBER       revision number
                                '{' DATE '}' revision at start of the date
                                'HEAD'       latest in repository
                                'BASE'       base rev of item's working copy
                                'COMMITTED'  last commit at or before BASE
                                'PREV'       revision just before COMMITTED
  -N [--non-recursive]     : operate on single directory only
  -q [--quiet]             : print as little as possible
  --diff3-cmd arg          : use ARG as merge command
  --relocate               : relocate via URL-rewriting
  --username arg           : specify a username ARG
  --password arg           : specify a password ARG
  --no-auth-cache          : do not cache authentication tokens
  --non-interactive        : do no interactive prompting
  --config-dir arg         : read user configuration files from directory ARG
