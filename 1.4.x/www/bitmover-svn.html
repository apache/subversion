<h2>Debunking BitMover's Subversion Comparison</h2>

<h3>Summary</h3>

<p>BitMover, Inc. offers a comparison between BitKeeper (their main
product) and Subversion, at</p>

<blockquote>
<p><a href="http://www.bitkeeper.com/Comparisons.Subversion.html"
           >http://www.bitkeeper.com/Comparisons.Subversion.html</a></p>
</blockquote>

<p>BitMover's comparison contains various false statements about
Subversion, and some misleading statements.  Below, we analyze
BitMover's page and set the record straight about Subversion.  The
entire relevant content of the BitMover page is quoted below, as it
looked on 2 July 2004.  We've omitted only extraneous things like
navigation links and the endorsement quote at the the top of the
page.</p>

<p>Please note that this response is strictly about Subversion.  We
have no complaints about BitKeeper as a piece of software; we've heard
mainly good things about it, though we can't try it ourselves because
of its <a href="#licensing">license situation</a>.</p>

<p>BitMover's text below is quoted in red italics where we feel it's
in error, and green italics otherwise.  Our annotations are in regular
black text.</p>

<h3>The Response</h3>

   <blockquote>
   <p style="color: red"><i>Subversion is a new system
   which is supposed to replace CVS. Unfortunately, Subversion shares
   many of CVS' problems and introduced some of its own
   problems:</i></p>
   </blockquote>

<!-- Commenting out this minor complaint for now:

<p>I like how they subtly imply that Subversion <i>only</i> adds new
problems on top of CVS's, without solving any problems.  It solved
many, of course, and while this quote doesn't explicitly deny that,
it's worded in a very misleading way.</p>

<p>Moving on to more substantive stuff:</p>

-->

   <blockquote>
   <p style="color: red"><i>Subversion uses a binary file format for
   your revision control data and metadata and if that format gets
   corrupted you are out of luck, your whole team comes to a
   halt.</i></p>
   </blockquote>

<p>That bit about the binary format is classic <a
href="http://www.catb.org/~esr/jargon/html/F/FUD.html">FUD</a>.  It's
quite true that Subversion uses a binary file format, but think about
it: BitMover is basically saying that databases are a bad idea, since
virtually all modern databases use a binary format.  Sure, if anything
happens to those files, you're out of luck, assuming you have no
backup.  So, does this mean no one should ever use a database?</p>

<p>Anyone who runs, say, Oracle, MySQL, Postgres, or another database
system should be able to see the silliness here right away.
Furthermore, it's clearly the case that if BitKeeper's data storage
format got corrupted severely enough, your whole team would come to a
halt too, at least for as long as it took to get everything fixed,
restored from backup, whatever.  Not so different from Subversion,
really.</p>

<p>There are database management issues to administering a Subversion
repository, of course, issues which CVS does not have.  If this is
BitMover's complaint, then they should say so, rather than making a
meaninglessly broad generalization.  (Note that Subversion now offers
a non-database back end, for those who don't want the overhead of
administering a database.  This is a fairly recent development, and
it's likely that BitMover simply hadn't heard about it yet when they
wrote their page.)</p>

   <blockquote>
   <p style="color: green"><i>Subversion has a single repository model,
   i.e., client/server. Each work area is clear text only which means
   no revision control in the work area during
   development.</i></p>
   </blockquote>

<p>This is basically true, though note that this way seems to work
fine for a lot of people.  Strictly speaking, Subversion has exactly
one level of revision control in the working copy, since there are
pristine base texts of every file present.  One can locally view one's
changes, revert them, or save them and then revert, all without a
network connection.</p>

   <blockquote>
   <p style="color: red"><i>No staging areas to protect the main source
   tree. With Subversion, everyone checks into the same place and if
   someone breaks the tree, it's broken for everyone. With BitKeeper,
   you can put a staging area between each group of developers and the
   main integration tree, thereby protecting the main tree from bad
   checkins. Anyone who has lived through a change that broke the
   build can see the value of staging areas.</i></p>
   </blockquote>

<p>False and FUD.</p>

<p>Having a staging area is a matter of how the project organizes its
repository and moderates its commits.  The fact that some projects
choose to use their main development trunk <i>as</i> their staging
area, and release from branches, is a matter of policy, not of
technical limitations.  If you want to insert an extra level of
staging area, Subversion supports that just fine.</p>

<p>Now, there might be a kernel of a real complaint here, which is
that Subversion doesn't have first-class changeset swapping, and
therefore merges from one branch to another (say, from staging to
live) don't preserve as much history as they could.  However,
BitMover's text goes far beyond that simple, circumscribed complaint.
And since they make the merge complaint separately later anyway, they
either thought they were saying something different here, or they're
making the same claim twice, for the sake of inflating their page.</p>

   <blockquote>
   <p style="color: green"><i>Subversion loses information every time
   there is parallel development because you are forced to merge
   before you check in if someone else checked in first. The state of
   your workspace before the merge is lost forever. Another way to say
   this is that if there is N-way parallel development, Subversion
   loses N-1 events.</i></p>
   </blockquote>

<p>As worded, this is not quite true.  But probably what they meant to
say was "you are forced to merge before you check in if someone else
checked in changes <i>to the same files</i> first."  Then it would be
true.</p>

<p>So how important is it?  It depends whom you ask.  BitMover
probably has in mind the "star merge" work style that has developed in
the Linux family of OSs, where there is never any expectation that all
workspaces will converge onto a single canonical form.  It's not about
how far behind you are, but about how different you wish to remain;
less about merging than about cherry-picking.  There are Subversion
users who ask for this.  We usually point them to <a
href="http://svk.elixus.org/">SVK</a>, which is based on Subversion
and supports this style of development, or to <a
href="http://www.gnuarch.org/">Arch</a>, an open-source revision
control system unrelated to Subversion.  But some others do not find
this a compelling feature; see <a
href="http://web.mit.edu/ghudson/thoughts/bitkeeper.whynot" >Greg
Hudson's explanation</a> why not.</p>

   <blockquote>
   <p style="color: green"><i>Merging in Subversion is no better than
   CVS, i.e., primitive at best.</i></p>
   </blockquote>

<p>This is basically true.  Subversion's merging <i>interface</i> is
better than CVS's, but the underlying operation leads to the same
result as in CVS.  Better merge support is on Subversion's long-term
todo list.</p>

   <blockquote>
   <p style="color: red"><i>Branch management in Subversion is a
   nightmare.</i></p>
   </blockquote>

<p>This is false, at least insofar as it means anything at all.
Without more technical substance to respond to, it's hard to know what
to do with such a claim; they don't say anything more concrete than
"nightmare", unfortunately.</p>

<p>Branch management is actually one of Subversion's strengths.  In
Subversion, branches are first class, versioned objects, just like
regular paths.  They can be copied, renamed, deleted, and
resurrected&nbsp;&mdash;&nbsp;and people do these things all the time.
Perhaps BitMover was really talking about merging?  But again, they
make the merging complaint elsewhere, so this item must presumably be
about something else.</p>

   <blockquote>
   <p style="color: red"><i>Subversion has no integrity checker which
   means files can be silently corrupted and you will never know until
   you try and roll backwards.</i></p>
   </blockquote>

<p>False.  Subversion ships with an integrity checker
(<tt>svnadmin&nbsp;verify</tt>).  It also attaches a checksum to every
revision of every file.  It verifies these checksums automatically at
every opportunity where it wouldn't have a serious impact on
performance; furthermore, it offers you the ability to paranoidly
check integrity even <i>more</i> often, if you want to, via the
abovementioned command.  So we really don't know what they're trying
to say here.</p>

   <blockquote>
   <p style="color: red"><i>Subversion has only weak rename support,
   that's something that is inherent in all centralized
   systems.</i></p>
   </blockquote>

<p>It's true that Subversion has weak rename support (work is under
way to fix this).  We don't see any reason why this is inherent in
centralized systems, or even why it has anything to do with
centralization or lack of same.  It sounds as if BitMover is trying to
imply that Subversion, due to its design, simply <i>can't</i> have
good rename support.  That's the more serious charge here, and we
believe it's totally bogus.</p>

<h3>Conclusion:</h3>

<p>What's really going on is that BitKeeper has just one or two solid
complaints to make: "Subversion has only primitive merge capability",
and possibly "Subversion doesn't do decentralized versioning."</p>

<p>While these are true, it seems like BitMover is attempting to say
each one multiple times, to have a longer itemized list of
deficiencies in Subversion.  If we ever write up our own comparison
between Subversion and BitKeeper, we'll avoid that sort of inflation.
Unfortunately, we can't easily make such a comparison, because
BitMover, Inc changed its license to prevent free software developers
who work on competing products (such as Subversion) from using
BitKeeper.</p>

<a name="licensing"></a>
<h3>BitKeeper's Licensing Situation:</h3>

<p>Before they changed their license, anyone could use BitKeeper for a
free software project (with a few minor caveats).  Although BitKeeper
was not "free" or "open source" in any important sense, since BitMover
still retained strong intellectual property rights over the code, it
did mean that free software developers could try it out and learn from
it.</p>

<p>Then BitMover added a clause to their license, ending this
availability for Subversion developers and others:</p>

<pre>
    (d)  Notwithstanding any other terms in this License, this
         License is not available to You if You and/or your
         employer develop, produce, sell, and/or resell a
         product which contains substantially similar capabil-
         ities of the BitKeeper Software, or, in the reason-
         able opinion of BitMover, competes with the BitKeeper
         Software.
</pre>

<p>(We'd include a reference to the full license here, but it appears
one must fill out a download form even to get to the license's
<i>text</i>, and that's a little more trouble than we're willing to go
through.)</p>

<p>Larry McVoy, founder of BitMover, <a
href="http://marc.theaimsgroup.com/?l=linux-kernel&amp;m=103384262016750&amp;w=2"
>confirmed</a> that the new clause prohibits Subversion developers
from trying BitKeeper at no charge.  Of course, Subversion developers
are free to purchase a license, but that is not a realistic option for
most of them.</p>

</ul>

<p>This is why we cannot make our own page comparing Subversion and
BitKeeper.  Of course, BitMover employees are free to download and
install Subversion any time, and we encourage them to do so.</p>
