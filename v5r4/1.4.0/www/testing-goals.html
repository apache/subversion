    <h3><a name="WHY">Why Test?</a></h3>

    <p>
      Regression testing is an essential element of high quality software.
      Unfortunately, some developers have not had first hand exposure to a
      high quality testing framework.  Lack of familiarity with the positive
      effects of testing can be blamed for statements like:
      <br/>
    </p>
    <blockquote>
      <p>"I don't need to test my code, I know it works."</p>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      It is safe to say that the idea that developers do not introduce
      bugs has been disproved.
    </p>


    <h3><a name="AUDIENCE">Audience</a></h3>

    <p>
      The test suite will be used by both developers and end users.
    </p>

    <p>
      <b>Developers</b> need a test suite to help with:
    </p>

    <p>
      <b><i>Fixing Bugs:</i></b>
      <br/>
      Each time a bug is fixed, a test case should be added to the test
      suite. Creating a test case that reproduces a bug is a seemingly
      obvious requirement. If a bug cannot be reproduced, there is no way to
      be sure a given change will actually fix the problem. Once a test case
      has been created, it can be used to validate the correctness of a
      given patch.  Adding a new test case for each bug also ensures that
      the same bug will not be introduced again in the future.
    </p>

    <p>
      <b><i>Impact Analysis:</i></b>
      <br/>
      A developer fixing a bug or adding a new feature needs to know if a
      given change breaks other parts of the code. It may seem obvious, but
      keeping a developer from introducing new bugs is one of the primary
      benefits of a using a regression test system.
    </p>

    <p>
      <b><i>Regression Analysis:</i></b>
      <br/>
      When a test regression occurs, a developer will need to manually
      determine what has caused the failure.  The test system is not able to
      determine why a test case failed. The test system should simply report
      exactly which test results changed and when the last results were
      generated.
    </p>

    <p>
      <b>Users</b> need a test suite to help with:
    </p>

    <p>
      <b><i>Building:</i></b>
      <br/>
      Building software can be a scary process.  Users that have never built
      software may be unwilling to try. Others may have tried to build a
      piece of software in the past, only to be thwarted by a difficult
      build process. Even if the build completed without an error, how can a
      user be confident that the generated executable actually works?  The
      only workable solution to this problem is to provide an easily
      accessible set of tests that the user can run after building.
    </p>

    <p>
      <b><i>Porting:</i></b>
      <br/>
      Often, users become porters when the need to run on a previously
      unsupported system arises. This porting process typically require some
      minor tweaking of include files.  It is absolutely critical that
      testing be available when porting since the primary developers may not
      have any way to test changes submitted by someone doing a port.
    </p>


    <p>
      <b><i>Testing:</i></b>
      <br/>
      Different installations of the exact same OS can contain subtle
      differences that cause software to operate incorrectly.  Only testing
      on different systems will expose problems of this nature. A test suite
      can help identify these sorts of problems before a program is actually
      put to use.
    </p>




    <h3><a name="REQUIREMENTS">Requirements</a></h3>

    <p>
      Functional requirements of an acceptable test suite include:
    </p>

    <p>
      <b><i>Unique Test Identifiers:</i></b>
      <br/>
      Each test case must have a globally unique test identifier, this
      identifier is just a string. A globally unique string is
      required so that test cases can be individually identified by
      name, sorted, and even looked up on the web.  It seems simple,
      perhaps even blatantly obvious, but some other test packages
      have failed to maintain uniqueness in test identifiers and
      developers have suffered because of it. It is even desirable for
      the system actively enforces this uniqueness requirement.
    </p>

    <p>
      <b><i>Exact Results:</i></b>
      <br/>
      A test case must have one expected result. If the result of
      running the tests does not exactly match the expected result,
      the test must fail.
    </p>

    <p>
      <b><i>Reproducible Results:</i></b>
      <br/>
      Test results should be reproducible.  If a test result matches
      the expected result, it should do so every time the test is
      run. External factors like time stamps must not effect the
      results of a test.
    </p>

    <p>
      <b><i>Self-Contained Tests:</i></b>
      <br/>
      Each test should be self-contained.  Results for one test should
      not depend on side effects of previous tests. This is obviously
      a good practice, since one is able to understand everything a
      test is doing without having to look at other tests. The test
      system should also support random access so that a single test
      or set of tests can be run. If a test is not self-contained, it
      cannot be run in isolation.
    </p>

    <p>
      <b><i>Selective Execution:</i></b>
      <br/>
      It may not be possible to run a given set of tests on certain
      systems. The suite must provide a means of selectively running
      tests cases based on the environment. The test system must also
      provide a way to selectively run a given test case or set of
      test cases on a per invocation basis. It would be incredibly
      tedious to run the entire suite to see the results for a single
      test.
    </p>

    <p>
      <b><i>No Monitoring:</i></b>
      <br/>
      The tests must run from start to end without operator
      intervention.  Test results must be generated automatically. It
      is critical that an operator not need to manually compare test
      results to figure out which tests failed and which ones passed.
    </p>


    <p>
      <b><i>Automatic Logging of Results:</i></b>
      <br/>
      The system must store test results so that they can be compared
      later. This applies to machine readable results as well as human
      readable results. For example, assume we have a test named
      <code>client-1</code>, it expects a result of 1 but instead 0 is
      returned by the test case.  We should expect the system to store
      two distinct pieces of information. First, that the test
      failed. Second, how the test failed, meaning how the expected
      result differed from the actual result.
    </p>

    <p>
      This following example shows the kind of results we might record
      in a results log file.
    </p>

      <pre><code>
   client-1 FAILED
   client-2 PASSED
   client-3 PASSED
    </code></pre>

    <p>
      <b><i>Automatic Recovery:</i></b>
      <br/>
      The test system must be able to recover from crashes and
      unexpected delays.  For example, a child process might go into a
      infinite loop and would need to be killed. The test shell itself
      might also crash or go into an infinite loop. In these cases,
      the test run must automatically recover and continue with the
      tests directly after the one that crashed.
    </p>

    <p>
      This is critical for a couple of reasons. Nasty crashes and
      infinite loops most often appear on users (not developers)
      systems. Users are not well equipped to deal with these sorts of
      exceptional situations.  It is unrealistic to expect that users
      will be able to manually recover from disaster and restart
      crashed test cases. It is an accomplishment just to get them to
      run the tests in the first place!
    </p>

    <p>
      Ensuring that the test system actually runs each and every test
      is critical, since a failing test near the end of the suite
      might never be noticed if a crash halfway through kept all the
      tests from being run.  This process must be completely
      automated, no operator intervention should be required.
    </p>


    <p>
      <b><i>Report Results Only:</i></b>
      <br/>
      When a regression is found, a developer will need to manually
      determine the reason for the regression.  The system should tell
      the developer exactly what tests have failed, when the last set
      of results were generated, and what the previous results
      actually were.  Any additional functionality is outside the
      scope of the test system.
    </p>

    <p>
      <b><i>Platform Specific Results:</i></b>
      <br/>
      Each supported platform should have an associated set of test
      results. The naive approach would be to maintain a single set of
      results and compare the output for any platform to the known
      results. The problem with this approach is that is does not
      provide a way to keep track of when changes differ from one
      platform to another. The following example attempts to clarify
      with an example.
    </p>

    <p>
      Assume you have the following tests results generated on a
      reference platform before and after a set of changes were
      committed.
    </p>

    <table border="1" cellspacing="2" cellpadding="2">

      <tr>
	<td><b>Before</b> (Reference Platform)</td>

	<td><b>After</b> (Reference Platform)</td>
      </tr>

      <tr>
	<td><code>client-1 PASSED</code></td>
	<td><code>client-1 PASSED</code></td>
      </tr>

      <tr>
	<td><code>client-2 PASSED</code></td>
	<td><code>client-2 FAILED</code></td>
      </tr>

    </table>

    <p>
      It is clear that the change you made introduced a regression in
      the <code>client-2</code> test.  The problem shows up when you
      try to compare results generated from this modified code on some
      other platform. For example, assume you got the following
      results:
    </p>

    <table border="1" cellspacing="2" cellpadding="2">

      <tr>
	<td><b>Before</b> (Reference Platform)</td>

	<td><b>After</b> (Other Platform)</td>
      </tr>

      <tr>
	<td><code>client-1 PASSED</code></td>
	<td><code>client-1 FAILED</code></td>
      </tr>

      <tr>
	<td><code>client-2 PASSED</code></td>
	<td><code>client-2 PASSED</code></td>
      </tr>

    </table>

    <p>
      Now things are not at all clear. We know that
      <code>client-1</code> is failing but we don't know if it is
      related to the change we just made. We don't know if this test
      failed the last time we ran the tests on this platform since we
      only have results for the reference platform to compare to. We
      might have fixed a bug in <code>client-2</code>, or we might
      have done nothing to effect it.
    </p>

    <p>
      If we instead keep track of test results on a platform by
      platform basis, we can avoid much of this pain. It is easy to
      imagine how this problem could get considerably worse if there
      were 50 or 100 tests that behaved differently from one platform
      to the next.
    </p>

    <p>
      <b><i>Test Types:</i></b>
      <br/>
      The test suite should support two types of tests. The first
      makes use of an external program like the svn client.  These
      kinds of tests will need to exec an external program and check
      the output and exit status of the child process. Note that it
      will not be possible to run this sort of test on Mac OS.  The
      second type of test will load subversion shared libraries and
      invoke methods in-process.
    </p>

    <p>
      This provides the ability to do extensive testing of the various
      subversion APIs without using the svn client. This also has the
      nice benefit that it will work on Mac OS, as well as Windows and
      Unix.
    </p>

    <h3><a name="EASEOFUSE">Ease of Use</a></h3>

    <p>
      Developers will tend to avoid using a test suite if it is not
      easy to add new tests and maintain old ones.  If developers are
      uninterested in using the test suite, it will quickly fall into
      disrepair and become a burden instead of an aide.
    </p>

    <p>
      Users will simply avoid running the test suite if it is not
      extremely simple to use. A user should be able to build the
      software and then run:
    </p>

    <blockquote>
      <p><code>
	% make check
      </code></p>
    </blockquote>

    <p>
      This should run the test suite and provide a very high level set
      of results that include how many tests results have changed
      since the last run.
    </p>

    <p>
      While this high level report is useful to developers, they will
      often need to examine results in more detail.  The system should
      provide a means to manually examine results, compare output,
      invoke a debugger, and other sorts of low level operations.
    </p>

    <p>
      The next example shows how a developer might run a specific
      subset of tests from the command line. The pattern given would
      be used to do a glob style match on the test case identifiers,
      and run any that matched.
    </p>

    <blockquote>
      <p><code>
	% svntest "client-*"
      </code></p>
    </blockquote>

    <h3><a name="LOCATION">Location</a></h3>

    <p>
      The test suite should be packaged along with the source code
      instead of being made available as a separate download. This
      significantly simplifies the process of running tests since they
      are already incorporated into the build tree.
    </p>

    <p>
      The test suite must support building and running inside and
      outside of the source directory. For example, a developer might
      want to run tests on both Solaris and Linux. The developer
      should be able to run the tests concurrently in two different
      build directories without having the tests interfere with each
      other.
    </p>


    <h3><a name="EXTERNAL">External program dependencies</a></h3>

    <p>
      As much as possible, the test suite should avoid depending on
      external programs or libraries.

      Of course, there is a nasty bootstrap problem with a test suite
      implemented in a scripting language. A wide variety of systems
      provide no support for modern scripting languages. We will avoid
      this issue for now and assume that the scripting language of
      choice is supported by the system.
    </p>

    <p>
      For example, the test suite should not depend on CVS to generate
      test results. Many users will not have access to CVS on the
      system they want to test subversion on.
