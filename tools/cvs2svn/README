This is a python script which converts a CVS repository to an SVN Repository.

   * converted the data in an unexpected or subtly wrong way.  It is   *
   * also not well-packaged yet.  For example, there's no easy way to  *
   * install it on your system: right now the recommended way to run   *
   * cvs2svn.py is right out of this directory, so it can find the     *
   * 'rcsparse' module on which it depends (see subdir rcsparse/).     *

All that said, the script has been used on straightforward CVS
repositories successfully.  As an example, the whole first year of
Subversion's own history was converted from CVS into a 3000+ revision
svn repository.  Your Mileage May Vary.  To see a list of all open
cvs2svn bugs, visit:

Using cvs2svn:
==============

* Prerequisites:

  - Install RCS.  cvs2svn.py uses the "co" command.  The RCS home page
    is http://www.cs.purdue.edu/homes/trinkle/RCS/.

  - Get at least Python 2.0; see http://www.python.org/.

  - Make sure you have GNU 'sort' installed, or some other sort
    program that handles large files other than by reading them
    entirely into memory.  GNU sort is part of the coreutils
    package, see http://www.gnu.org/software/coreutils/.

  - If you're not running cvs2svn.py from this directory, then make
    sure to install the rcsparse/ tree somewhere where Python can
    find it.  Note that it's a CVS working copy, so we can update
    it easily :-).  Except for 'compat.py', which comes from
    viewcvs/lib/compat.py.

    Rcsparse is currently part of ViewCVS, see
    http://viewcvs.sourceforge.net/.  Someday rcsparse will be an
    independent Python project, and then we can depend on it in a
    more normal way.

* Basic usage:

  To create a new Subversion repository by converting an existing CVS
  repository, run the script like this:

     $ cvs2svn.py --create -s NEW_SVNREPOS CVSREPOS

  To create a new Subversion repository containing only trunk commits,
  and omitting all branches and tags from the CVS repository, do

     $ cvs2svn.py --trunk-only --create -s NEW_SVNREPOS CVSREPOS

  To create a Subversion dumpfile (suitable for 'svnadmin load') from
  a CVS repository, run it like this:

     $ cvs2svn.py --dump-only --dumpfile DUMPFILE CVSREPOS

As it works, cvs2svn.py will create many temporary files in the
current directory.  This is normal.  If the entire conversion is
successful, however, those tempfiles will be automatically removed.
If the conversion is not successful, or if you specify the
'--skip-cleanup' option, cvs2svn will leave the temporary files behind
for possible debugging.

To see more options, run:

     $ cvs2svn.py --help
