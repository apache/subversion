# Script to construct a KEYS file by fetching public keys of full
# committers as listed in the COMMITTERS file from people.apache.org.
#
# Based on "a piece of code" posted by danielsh on 22 Mar 2022 in the
# thread "Questions on Release Management Process":
# https://mail-archives.apache.org/mod_mbox/subversion-dev/202203.mbox/%3C20220323035056.GY7687%40tarpaulin.shahaf.local2%3E
#
# Run in the top directory of a checkout of SVN's sources, where the
# COMMITTERS file is located.
#
# This will download a bunch of .asc files and then cat them together
# to form a KEYS file.
#
# Requires curl. (Could be reworked to use wget, too, I suppose.)
