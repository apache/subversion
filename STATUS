Status of 1.8.10:

Candidate changes:
==================

 * r1469519, r1469520, r1481848, r1481870
   Silence compiler warnings, tighten scopes and improve code.
   Justification:
     Clean builds make it more likely to notice real compiler warnings.
   Branch: ^/subversion/branches/1.8.x-r1469519-and-friends
   Votes:
     +1: blair, brane
     -0: philip (see dev thread: false alarm, trades one warning for another)

 * r1501293, r1501338, r1501360, r1501533
   Fix issue #4390, "parallel nested checkout not possible with wc-ng"
   Justification:
     Regression from 1.6. User complained. See issue for details.
   Branch:
     ^/subversion/branches/1.8.x-issue4390
   Depends:
     Nomination conflicts with the branch and merges cleanly without it.
     Branch should probably be removed from the nomination (it was only needed
     before r1503552).
   Votes:
     +1: stsp
     -0: ivan, brane (not regression from 1.7.x,
                      destructive change in libsvn_wc core)
     -0: rhuijben (temporarily remove my +1 until I complete investigating
                   a related problem. It looks like this fix doesn't work for
                   the user scenario it was intended for)

 * r1536854
   Make 'svnadmin verify' detect inconsistencies that will prevent loading
   dump files.
   Justification:
     Some users rely on dump files as a means of repository backup.  Without
     this patch, there is no way except of 'svnadmin load' to know that these
     dump files will load at all.  With this patch, a successful verify run
     should guarantee loadable dump files.
   Branch: ^/subversion/branches/1.8.x-r1536854
   Votes:
     +1: stefan2

 * r1542610, r1564576, r1568180
   Add missing description to build.conf, to properly generate a version
   resource (including icon) for this executable on Windows.
   Notes:
     r1564576 breaks compilation on Visual Studio 2010, 2012 and 2013 of
     this project. r1568180 fixes this problem.
   Votes:
     +1: rhuijben, breser
     +1: (without r1564567, r1568180): stsp
     -0: brane (horrible grammar; suggest translation to English)

 * r1555491
   Fix svn_fs_close_root for FSFS transaction roots.
   Justification:
     Without this patch, cache-related pool cleanups may be run after the
     svn_fs_t object has been destroyed.  I.e. even with explicit calls to
     svn_fs_close_root, the user may see a segfault.
   Branch:
     ^/subversion/branches/1.8.x-r1555491
   Votes:
     +1: stefan2
     -0: philip, rhuijben (Seems to be a different name for the same pool?)

 * r1547454
   In FSFS, omit config file when creating pre-1.5 format repositories.
   Justification:
     Old SVN versions won't preserve this file in hotcopy.  Later versions
     might also behave inconsistently in the presence of this file if their
     feature availability check is incomplete.
   Votes:
     +1: stefan2
     -0: rhuijben (Might require r1561703 to avoid breaking tests)

 * r1561426
   In FSFS, skip the generation of uniquifiers if rep-shared is no supported.
   Branch: ^/subversion/branches/1.8.x-r1561426
   Justification:
     This is not known to be a bug, atm, as we omit these when we write the
     final revisions.  But we rely on those uniquifiers to be NULL in old
     repo formats when we compare reps.  Them being non-NULL in a txn might
     cause problems with future changes.
   Votes:
     +1: stefan2

 * r1567996, r1568009, r1568062, r1568063
   Fix a caching inefficiency in multi-threaded servers.
   Justification:
     .
   Notes:
     Due to going back and forth with different approaches to solve this
     issue, the best way to review this 
   Branch:
     ^/subversion/branches/1.8.x-r1567996
   Votes:
     +1: stefan2
     -0: rhuijben (incomplete (misses cache->total_reads accesses) and
                   overkill. The whole thing can be implemented with simple
                   atomic operations while mutexes may be a limited resource)

 * r1589184, r1589188
   Properly handle properties not present and excluded on cross wc copy
   Justification:
     Cross working copy copies should just work.
   Votes:
     +1: rhuijben

 * r1589360
   Make property output in 'svn diff' stable
   Justification:
     Local change that makes it easier to compare patch files.
   Votes:
     +1: rhuijben
     -0: stefan2 (compiler misses "private/svn_sorts_private.h")
     
 * r1589460, r1589486
   Fix copying parents of locally deleted nodes between working copies.
   Justification:
     Resolves a case of creating invalid working copy state.
   Votes:
     +1: rhuijben

 * r1590751
   Use empty, rather than NULL, config if default is unreadable.
   Justification:
     svn SEGV reported by user.
   Votes:
     +1: philip
     -0: julianfoad (prefer to fix all the programs at the same time;
                     other queries -- see email thread)

 * r1591123
   Display the proper URL for 'svn rm URL' in the commit log editor.
   Justification:
     It's confusing since the URL isn't what the user passed.  Regression since
     1.7.9 when we fixed issue #4332.
   Votes:
     +1: breser, rhuijben

 * r1592014, r1592034
   Fix 'svn patch' skipping targets in valid --git diffs.
   Justification:
     'svn patch' should parse --git diffs correctly. User complained.
     See http://svn.haxx.se/users/archive-2014-05/0003.shtml and replies.
   Votes:
     +1: stsp

 * r1593992
   Remove useless warning about ruby during configure.
   Justification:
     Ruby 1.9 support has been there for a while.  Telling people iff they
     are using Ruby 1.9.3 that the support is new is useless.
   Votes:
     +1: breser, rhuijben

 * r1594156
   Fix a problem with the Unix build that could result in linking to the wrong
   Subversion libraries at build time or at run time.
   Justification:
     Building and testing should Just Work as far as possible.
   Votes:
     +1: julianfoad

 * r1594223, r1553501, r1553556, r1559197
   Fix a URI-escaping bug in ra_serf and add a regression test for it.
   Justification:
     Committing a deletion of a locked path should work.
   Notes:
     As a nice side effect the behavior change of this patch also resolves
     Issue #3674: Replace + propset of locked file fails over DAV, and avoids
     some duplicated requests by providing better lock information during
     commit.
   Branch:
     ^/subversion/branches/1.8.x-r1594223
   Votes:
     +1: stsp, rhuijben

 * r1594794, r1594814, r1594834, r1595061
   Fix the notify_func callbacks in Python bindings.
   Justification:
     Slightly broken implementation made them impossible to use.
   Votes:
     +1: breser

 * r1595431
   Use a proper intermediate directory when building with VS 2003-2008.
   Justification:
     Reported as a build problem by some of our usual dist signers.
   Votes:
     +1: rhuijben

 * r1596866
   Fix another instance of issue #3014, "svn log | head" should not
   print "Write error: Broken pipe"
   Justification:
     Minor annoyance, already fixed for other cases.
   Votes:
     +1: stsp

 * r1600311, r1600315, r1600323, r1600393
   Properly delete ancestor directories of externals when removing the
   external by changing the svn:externals value.
   Justification:
     Regression against 1.7.x
   Branch:
     ^/subversion/branches/1.8.x-rm-external-dir
   Votes:
     +1: rhuijben

  * r1600331, r1600348, 1600368, r1600563, r1600781
    Improve gpg-agent support.
    Justification: Avoids spurious error logs, supports standard socket
      locations and removes double prompts from pinentry.  Without these
      changes it's far less desireable to use.
    Notes:
      Branch is needed since SVN_VA_NULL is not available in 1.8.x.
      This does change the behavior of gpg-agent from prompting twice
      for the password with pinentry to confirm the user hasn't entered
      an incorrect password to instead clearing bad cached passwords and
      reprompting.  See my email on the subject: https://mail-archives.apache.org/mod_mbox/subversion-dev/201406.mbox/%3C538D2BE5.3070706%40reser.org%3E

Veto-blocked changes:
=====================

 * r1524145
   Make the 'm' conflict prompt option run external merge tool if configured.
   Justification:
     Usability fix. The current behaviour ('m' -> internal merge tool,
     'l' -> external merge tool) confuses users who try 'm' to run an
     external merge tool. See issue #4426.
   Votes:
     +1: stsp
     -1: breser (see my email to dev@, <5282FE15.40505@reser.org>)

 * r1560723, r1561419, r1561427, r1561428
   Fix the handling of pre-1.4 FSFS repositories.
   Branch: ^/subversion/branches/1.8.x-r1560723-and-friends
   Justification:
     Without this, old SVN versions won't be able to e.g. hotcopy those
     repos once 1.8.x made a commit in them.  Also, fix our hotcopy code
     and make it cope with repositories broken by previous 1.8.x releases.
   Votes:
     +1: stefan2
     -1: ivan (Significant performance degradation for svnadmin hotcopy,
               the root cause is not fixed. Discussion:
               http://svn.haxx.se/dev/archive-2014-01/0158.shtml)
