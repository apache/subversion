This file tracks the status of releases in the 1.5.x line.

See "Stabilizing and maintaining releases" in trunk/www/hacking.html for
details on how release lines and voting work, what kinds of bugs can
delay a release, etc.

Status of 1.5.0:
================

Candidate changes:

 * r30544
   Remove the now-unused svn_wc_notify_changelist_failed enum element,
   and change libsvn_wc to clear the error it passes to its
   notification callback.
   Justification:
     This take the (undocumented) responsibility for this cleanup off
     of the library consumer (who would potentially otherwise leak
     errors).
   Notes:
     This is a follow-up to r28591, which is a fix for issue #3054,
     'svn cl foo README; svn cl foo README' has unexpected output.
