This file tracks the status of releases in the 1.3.x line.

details on how release lines and voting work, what kinds of bugs can
delay a release, etc.

Status of 1.3.0:
================

Candidate changes:

  * r16456
    Add notes on new Python version of svnmerge, where to find
      it.  Rename Bourne shell svnmerge to svnmerge.sh to make
      space for Python version.
    Justification:
      Good to get consistent filenames for scripts in all 1.3.x
      releases.  It's in the contrib directory.

  * r16369
    Align implementation of repository creation with claims made in
    svn_repos.h's doc string.
    Justification:
      Correctness, and fixes SWIG Python and Perl tests.

  * r16344, r16347, r16358, 16375
    Branch: (to be created)
    Provide more complete server-side information about working copy
    items which are out of date in the repository.
    Justification:
      This info is extremely useful to Subversion clients; the first
      consumer is likely to be the "Synchronize" view of the Subclipse
      plug-in for the Eclipse IDE.
    Votes:
      +1: dlr

  * r16350
    Fix issue #1911, where svndumpfilter generated invalid dumpfiles
    when copies occurred and --drop-empty-revs and --renumber-revs
    were in use.
    Justification:
      Invalid dumpfiles are not nice.
    Votes:
      +1: cmpilato
      +0: dlr (concept, new to this area of the code)

  * r16372
    Fix shell test in Makefile breaking swig-py build, due to sometimes
    misidentifying a srcdir == objdir build as a srcdir != objdir build.
    Justification:
      Tiny fix, broken build bad.
    Votes:
      +1: maxb, djames

  * r16387
    Fix issue 2406 - Do not pass URL-encoded hostname to ra_svn tunnel agent.
    Justification:
      Small bug, easy fix, of value to Windows users of PuTTY.
    Votes:
      +1: maxb

  * r16388, r16408
    Fix numerous bugs in the svn_fs_*berkeley*() APIs.
    Fix issue 2361 (recover on a FSFS repository errors if BDB not linked).
    Fix creation of BDB files in FSFS repositories by 'svnadmin recover',
      'svnadmin list-dblogs' and 'svnadmin list-unused-dblogs'.
    Justification:
      Not vital, but the creation of Berkeley DB files in a FSFS repository
      is a long standing bug which doesn't really give a good impression.

      +1: maxb

  * r16398
    Fix Issue #2172 (segfaults in the Python bindings caused by pool lifetime
    problems).
    Justification:
      Segfaults are bad. In 1.3.x, Python bindings users should not have to
      worry about memory pools.
    Votes:
      +1: djames

  * r16414
    Ensure that SWIG external runtime dependencies are correctly added
    to build-outputs.mk.
    Justification:
      Easily reviewable, might save someone some problems.
    Votes:
      +1: djames

  * r16424
    Avoid gcc uninitialized warning.
    Justificiation:
      Should build without warnings.
    Votes:
      +1: maxb

  * r16426
    Fix missing make rules relating to the perl/ruby SWIG external runtimes.
    Justification:
      Avoid build errors when certain combinations of make targets are invoked.
    Votes:
      +1: maxb, djames

  * r16428
    Activate some Windows-specific behaviour on Cygwin too:
     - SVN_ASP_DOT_NET_HACK
     - Windows-specific augmented file:// URLs
    Justification:
      Cygwin is likely to be exposed to native-Windows-created WCs.
    Votes:
      +1: maxb, dlr

  * r16437
    Remove needless "case" clause.
    Justification:
      The needless clause maybe cause a problem.
      For example:
        http://subversion.tigris.org/servlets/ReadMsg?list=dev&msgNo=106222

  * r16468
    Make VPATH (srcdir != builddir) doc-api builds work.
    Justification:
      Make it easier for packagers to build doxygen docs.
    Votes:
      +1: maxb, dlr

Approved changes (further review is welcome, but not required):

  * r16405
    Fix issue #2411 (merge requires write access to '.')
    Justification:
      Merge should use the .svn/tmp directory.  The current situation can
      lead to unnecessary extra copying between devices (when the wc is on
      another device than '.').
