This file tracks the status of releases in the 1.1.x line.

See "Stabilizing and maintaining releases" in trunk/HACKING for
details on how release lines and voting work, what kinds of bugs can
delay a release, etc.

Status of 1.1.3:
================

Candidate changes:

  * r12075, r12448
    Add pre-0.14 dumpfile compatability.
    Justification: Some very old clients were recently spotted in
    the wild.  And: Dumpfile compatibility is always good.
    Notes: These look good to me, but are complex enough that I'm not
      comfortable +1'ing without testing on an old dumpfile, and I
      haven't done that yet.  -kfogel

      (r12075 only) +1: ghudson
      -0: bliss (because the patch is non-trivial and there is only a
                 single known pre-0.14 user)
      +0: kfogel

  * r11050
    Add install dependencies for libsvn_fs and libsvn_fs_base.
    Justification:
      Allows users to install JavaHL separately, without needing to
      compile and install the base subversion package.  Without this
      fix, JavaHL installation crashes in that case.

  * r12483
    Fix the error message if the version of SWIG is wrong.
    Justification:
      It's confusing when you have 1.3.24 and it tells you that
      you need 1.3.19 or newer...

  * r12144, r12485
    Adds type caching to the perl bindings.  Otherwise mostly
    adds a code cleanup.
    Branch: 1.1.x-r12144
    Justificaton:
      Makes the perl bindings build with r12397 which we merged
      already.

  * r12576
    Fix JavaHL run-time link error by properly depending on libsvn_repos.
    Justification: 
      Fixes run-time error seen by Subclipse users with RedHat Fedora.

  * r12630
    Dataloss bug in svndumpfilter - copyfrom information lost for files
    copied-with-modifications.
    Justification:
      Dataloss!
    Branch:
      1.1.x-svndumpfilter r12655:12656
    Votes:
      +1: maxb

  * r12636
    Dataloss bug in svndumpfilter - delete-all-properties-from-node operations
    are lost.
    Justification:
      Dataloss!
    Branch:
      1.1.x-svndumpfilter r12656:12657
      Does not itself conflict, but present on branch so that does not
      cause conflicts in the merge of later revisions.
    Votes:
      +1: maxb

  * r12637, r12640
    Very bad memory handling in svndumpfilter - caches an entire revision
    of data in memory.
    Justification:
      Makes the use of svndumpfilter on dumpstreams containing files
      larger than available RAM, or revisions in which the total size of
      changed files is larger than available RAM, totally impossible.
      This is a showstopper bug, since we do not have obliterate.
    Notes:
      r12637 is purely re-ordering of entire functions with no effective
      code changes whatsoever, in order to make the diff of r12640 more
      easily reviewable.
    Branch:
      1.1.x-svndumpfilter r12657:12659
      (Each merged revision committed to branch seperately)
    Votes:
      +1: maxb

  * r12499, r12542, plus branch-only modification in r12670
    Make mailer.py work on Windows.
    Justification:
      Our flagship mailing hook-script should work on all platforms.
    Notes:
      The branch-only modification was inlining a piece of code available
      in the 1.2 and later Python bindings into mailer.py so that it can
      function with 1.1 bindings.
    Branch:
      1.1.x-mailer.py r12543:HEAD
    Votes:
      +1: maxb

Approved changes (further review is welcome, but not required):

Status of 1.1.4:
================

Candidate changes:

  * r12489
    Fix a confusing error message.  Issue #2174
    Justification:
      Users have no clue what to do about it not being locked and usually 
      if it's "not locked" it's a programmer error.  User errors will be
      probably that the dir is missing...
    Notes: This is under 1.1.4 so we don't include it in 1.1.3 which will
      be done to fix some small issues with 1.1.2.  Don't want to break
      translations.
