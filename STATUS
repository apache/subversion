This file tracks the status of releases in the 1.5.x line.

See "Stabilizing and maintaining releases" in trunk/www/hacking.html for
details on how release lines and voting work, what kinds of bugs can
delay a release, etc.

Note: Because we anticipate a reasonable amount of new development
will still be required for Subversion 1.5, we are for the the time
being applying the "somewhat looser voting system for areas that are
not core code" to the entire branch.

Status of 1.5.0:
================

Candidate changes:

 * r29101
     Avoid unnecessary RA reparenting operations.
   Votes:
     +1: kfogel

 * r29098
     Add trivial early-out check, reindenting as a result.
   Votes:
     +1 kfogel

 * r29107, r29085:
     Stop merge from adding mergeinfo from a target's own history.
   Notes:
     No real functional change in terms of what gets merged and what doesn't,
     but it does reduce redundant explicit mergeinfo in some common use cases.
     Merging notes: We should port these together (see r29107 log msg
     for why), but to avoid some time-wasting merge conflicts, port
     29107 only after r29098 and r29101 (which are now proposed above).
   Votes:
     +1: pburba (r29085 only), kfogel (r29085 and r29107)

Approved changes:

 * r29101; recommended-but-not-required: r29098
   Protect against some unnecessary (and sometimes expensive) RA reparentings
   Notes:
     r29098 isn't required, but is a formatting tweak that touches a bunch of
     lines, some of which are also touched by r29101.
   Votes:
     +1: cmpilato, pburba
