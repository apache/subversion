This file tracks the status of releases in the 1.5.x line.

See "Stabilizing and maintaining releases" in trunk/www/hacking.html for
details on how release lines and voting work, what kinds of bugs can
delay a release, etc.


Candidate changes for 1.5.6:
============================

 * r36106
   Resolves issue #3374, "svn cp --parents path URL encoding issues"
   For
     svn cp --parent ^/fö ^/dö/fö
   The --parents code checked and might creat^/d%C3%B6, while the file was
   copied to ^/dö as expected.
   Justification:
     Without this patch --parents is broken for utf8 characters in repos
     to repos copy and move operations.
   Votes:
     +1: rhuijben
     -0: gstein (encoding issues are tricky; I'd rather tell people to
                 upgrade to 1.6.0, rather than 1.5.6)

 * r36111
   On Windows don't retry deleting a file 100 times when this file is really
   not a file but just a directory.
   Justification:
     Makes removing unversioned directories much faster.
     (You can see the delay with: svn rm --force <unversioned-empty-directory>)
   Votes:
     +1: rhuijben
     -0: gstein (edge case performance fixes shouldn't be backported; if
                 the user wants the fix, they can upgrade to 1.6.0 rather
                 than 1.5.6)


Approved changes:
=================

 * r35297, r35367
   Allow svn_mergeinfo_parse() to tolerate unordered rangelists as input
   while still guaranteeing the mergeinfo it creates has sorted rangelists
   as required by all our rangelist manipulating APIs.
   Justification:
     Versions of svnmerge-migrate-history.py and
     svnmerge-migrate-history-remotely.py prior to r35358 could create
     mergeinfo in the repos with rangelists sorted in reverse order.
     Prior to r35297 this broke any subcommand which encountered this
     mergeinfo because svn_mergeinfo_parse returned a parsing error.
   Votes:
     +1: pburba, rhuijben
     +1: gstein (as long as r35713 does not get vetoed out of the release)

 * r35466, r35712, r35713
   Allow svn_mergeinfo_parse() to tolerate overlapping rangelists as input
   while still guaranteeing the mergeinfo it creates has no overlapping
   rangelists as required by all our rangelist manipulating APIs.
   r35713 fixes a possible range shrinkage introduced in r35466. (r35712 is
   a testcase for this issue).
   Justification:
     svnmerge-migrate-history.py and svnmerge-migrate-history-remotely.py
     can create mergeinfo with overlapping rangelists, which breaks any
     subcommand which encounters this mergeinfo because svn_mergeinfo_parse
     returns a parsing error.
    Note: Will conflict if r35297 group is not applied first.  Assuming
    r35297 is already merged, accept theirs-conflict on
    subversion\tests\libsvn_subr\mergeinfo-test.c to avoid a minor conflict.
    Votes:
     +1: rhuijben, pburba, gstein
