Status of 1.1.1:
================

Candidate changes:

  * r10788, r10796, r10904, r10914
    Fix performance regression in character encoding translations.  Most
    noticable on Win32, but impacts other platforms as well.
    Justification:
      Slow "svn status" annoys people, especially TSVN users.
    Notes:
      Proposed during 1.1.0 preparation, but it is too late and complicated
      to put in 1.1.0 at this stage.
      This conflicts with the branch.  A patch against r11308 is here:

      Don't show 'Internal Server Error' when accessing the root of SVNParentPath
      with mod_authz_svn.
    Justification:
      This looks ugly to the users and the fix is simple.

  * r11190
    Make it possible to set SVNPathAuthz to Off.
    Justification:
      There is a performance regression from 1.0 when it's set to On
      (which is why it was implemented in the first place).

  * r11224 (Issue 2070)
    Exporting symlinks with use-commit times set fails.

      Showstopper when using symlinks.  One-liner.
    Votes:
      +1: bliss, lundblad

  * r11250, r11258
    Fix #2060, make ls work when path contians non-ASCII chars over ra_dav.
    Justification:
      BFI, ls-R didn't work at all in this case, affects many GUI clients.

      +1: lundblad, brane

  * r11233, r11260
    Fix eol-style conversion for propedit.
    Justification:
      Editing props with newlines (svn:ignore, svn:log...) is annoying without
      this.
    Note:
      This also fixes --encoding with propedit.

  * r11262, r11274

  * r11215, r11264
      SVN has needed a good packaging script for Win32 since forever.
    Justification:
      This and the related build and test script changes will make
      creating 1.1.x Win32 binary packages a lot easier.
    Votes:
      +1: brane

  * r11290
      Fix an error in the perl bindings.

  * r11294
    Fix issue #2090. Don't send invalid XML over DAV.
