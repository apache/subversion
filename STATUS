Candidate changes for 1.5.5:
============================

 * r30257, r33024, r33026
   Don't try to filter natural history from added mergeinfo during
   reverse merges.
   Notes:
     r30257 is the urelated removal of an unused private struct in merge.c,
     not required but avoids a conflict with r33024.  r33024 is a change to
     include more information in the merge command baton, it results in no
     functional change itself but r33026 relies on this new information.
     There's a single trailing whitespace conflict during merge of r33024.
     r33026 is the core change.
   Justification:
     A reverse merge should simply return mergeinfo to a previous
     representation -- see
     http://subversion.tigris.org/servlets/ReadMsg?listName=dev&msgNo=142777.
     This change also improves reverse merge performance as it eliminates
     some unnecessary communication with the repository.

 * r33866
   Make ra_svn's Cyrus auth implementation (like the internal auth
   implementation) always prefer EXTERNAL to ANONYMOUS.  This prevents
   a weird regression vs 1.4 where svn+ssh:// would be treated as
   anonymous in some cases.
   Justification:
     Regression against 1.4 which can prevent users from even checking
     out repositories that they could check out with a 1.4 client.
   Votes:
     +1: glasser

* r33873, r33874
  Old API-accessible bug where a certain combination of revision
  arguments to svn_repos_get_logs returns garbage.  Has tests.
