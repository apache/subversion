   Votes:
     +1: arfrever
     -0: stsp (we can backport these when we need to)
     -0: gstein
     -1: rhuijben (Keep the candidate list readable, by removing unneeded
                   backports. Should be part of the backport change when
                   needed)

=================

 * r1235831, r1236099
   Tweak the parsing of the ssl-authority-files config option to make it
   easier for users to configure.

 * r1292090, r1292827
   Fix issue #4123 'URL-to-WC copy of externals fails on Windows'.

     a regression from 1.6.
