Status of 1.8.6:

Candidate changes:
==================

 * r1469519, r1469520, r1481848, r1481870
   Silence compiler warnings, tighten scopes and improve code.
   Justification:
     Clean builds make it more likely to notice real compiler warnings.
   Branch: ^/subversion/branches/1.8.x-r1469519-and-friends
   Votes:
     +1: blair, brane
     -0: philip (see dev thread: false alarm, trades one warning for another)

 * r1498000
   Improve error handling for inherited property requests by using the
   transition based xml parser in libsvn_ra_serf.
   Justification:
     This maintenance work which usually doesn't belong in a patch release
     makes it possible to properly detect if this request should be restarted
     on non-chunk-enabled proxies.
   Votes:
     +1: rhuijben, ivan

 * r1496127
   Fix occasional failure of checkout_tests.py 12.
   Justification:
     Spurious FAILs confuse people testing the release.
   Votes:
     +1: philip, rhuijben
     -0: danielsh (loses functionality; patch sent with alternative fix)
     stsp: where exactly is the alternative patch?
     danielsh: http://mid.gmane.org/20130705040533.GL3244@lp-shahaf.local

 * r1501293, r1501338, r1501360, r1501533
   Fix issue #4390, "parallel nested checkout not possible with wc-ng"
   Justification:
     Regression from 1.6. User complained. See issue for details.
   Branch:
     ^/subversion/branches/1.8.x-issue4390
   Depends:
     Nomination conflicts with the branch and merges cleanly without it.
     Branch should probably be removed from the nomination (it was only needed
     before r1503552).
   Votes:
     +1: stsp
     -0: ivan, brane (not regression from 1.7.x,
                      destructive change in libsvn_wc core)
     -0: rhuijben (temporarily remove my +1 until I complete investigating
                   a related problem. It looks like this fix doesn't work for
                   the user scenario it was intended for)

 * r1534149, r1535676
   In the windows CryptoAPI ssl certificate verification, properly handle
   certificates that are only trusted via intermediate authorities.
   Justification:
      While not strictly a bug, intermediate authorities are getting more
      common since recent Certificate Authority incidents.
   Notes:
      rhuijben: This introduces a new credential type as private API.
      Not sure about our strict ABI guarantees here, but this affects
      usability of users migrating to cloud platforms, etc.
   Votes:
     +1: rhuijben

 * r1535115
   Make JavaHL tests run without installing on OS X.
   Justification:
     Shouldn't need to install code to test it.
   Votes:
     +1: breser, brane

 * r1535532
   Make the certificate verification handling in ra_serf properly ask multiple
   providers for acceptance of certificate failures.
   Justification:
     Without this patch it is not possible to have one hook accept invalid
     ca roots, while another provider accepts an invalid date on a certificate.
     Probably only interesting for bindings and code that explicitly tests
     our certificate handling behavior.
   Votes:
     +1: rhuijben

 * r1531014, r1532316, r1536350, r1536383, r1536464, r1536488
   Fix working copy database inconsistency on certain move scenarios,
   including those described in issue #4437 "Deleting a moved file can maintain a
   half move"
   Justification:
     The working copy database should be consistent on any normal operation.
   Votes:
     +1: rhuijben

 * r1518942, r1536914, r1536931
   Fix commit of a specific mixed revision copy with non copy descendants that
   shadow not present nodes. This problem manifests itself as a copy of a tree
   that can't be committed because it is reported out of date.
   Justification:
     'svn cp TREE NEW-TREE; svn ci NEW-TREE' should never report out of date
     on some random descendant.
   Branch: ^/subversion/branches/1.8.x-r1536931
   Votes:
     +1: rhuijben

 * r1537018
   Fix issue #4440, "Subversion sets permissions on files, when it shouldn't"
   Justification:
     Bug introduced by me. Unreasonable behaviour. User complained.
   Votes:
     +1: stsp, stefan2
     +0.5: rhuijben (Change looks sane, but I'm unable to test this)

 * r1538812, r1538925, r1538928, r1538939
   Properly remove moved_to information when the node in its original location
   is removed.
   Justification:
     The NODES table in the working copy database should always be consistent.
   Notes:
     rhuijben: The test for this problem might accidentally depend on other
               move fixes on trunk.
   Votes:
     +1: rhuijben, philip

 * r1542610
   Add missing description to build.conf, to properly generate a version
   resource (including icon) for this executable on Windows.
   Votes:
     +1: rhuijben, stsp
     -0: brane (horrible grammar; suggest translation to English)

 * r1542765, r1542767, r1542774
   Add or update an 'sqlite_stat1' table when creating or upgrading a database
   to make the Sqlite 3.8 'NG' query planner work with us instead of against
   us.
   Notes:
     r1542765 is the actual fix and a testcase which makes sure we don't
     accidentally add bad information whenever we update the schema.
     r1542767 and r1542774 are test suite tweaks to improve test coverage and
     to make sure we don't have false positive test failures on Sqlite 3.8.X.
   Votes:
     +1: rhuijben, brane

 * r1543961
   Fix SWIG bindings building on OS X out of the tarball.
   Justification:
     Regression since 1.8
   Notes:
     Test by running ./autogen.sh --release and then building bindings
     on OS X.  Even if you run ./autogen.sh on a Mac the issue will
     still replicate.
   Votes:
     +1: breser, brane

 * r1544597, r1544600, r1544688, r1544690, r1545111, r1545122
   Fix a specific case where the api behind status would report a different
   move status for A depending on whether the user called 'svn status A' or
   'svn status wc/A'.
   Justification:
     Api users such as AnkhSVN rely on the result of svn status to match and
     this breaks their assumptions.
     This change has the nice side effect that it resolves the most common
     user triggerable assertion in AnkhSVN, which is really caused by a
     broken move. (See other nomination for a fix). But even then it shouldn't
     matter how status is called: on the node or an ancestor.
     (It also improves status performance a tiny bit, by reducing the number
      of sqlite transactions used)
   Votes:
     +1: rhuijben

 * r1544878, r1544895
   Fix output of svn --version -v to not cut info off on linux.
   Justification:
     Obviously wrong.
   Notes:
     The relevant code is #ifdeffed out on anything but linux.
   Votes:
     +1: breser (without r1544895), rhuijben, danielsh

 * r1548105
   mod_dav_svn: Fix SVNAllowBulkUpdates directive merging.
   Justification:
     'SVNAllowBulkUpdates on' does not override other values
     configured for other <Location>
   Votes:
     +1: ivan

 * r1547774
   Fix 'svn checkout ^/subversion/trunk NAS' of working copy with symlinks
   on Windows where the NAS doesn't implement FlushFileBuffers().
   Regression since 1.7.
   Justification:
     The checkout of symlink replacements shouldn't require more network
     capabilities than ordinary checkouts.
   Votes:
     +1: rhuijben

 * r1548486
   When (during merge) we compare three files to each other stop reading
   specific files when we find enough differences.
   Justification:
     Trivial fix that can have a huge performance impact for some users.
   Votes:
     +1: rhuijben

 * r1549858, r1549874
   Make svn_client_proplist4() behave as documented when reporting inherited
   properties.
   Justification:
     The current implementation with multiple callbacks for the same path
     just makes things hard on api users that want to use inherited properties
     as intended.
   Votes:
     +1: rhuijben

 * r1541638, r1545302
   Fix automatic relocate during update for working copies that are
   not at repository root.
   Justification:
     Makes it much easier on users when their hoster migrates from http
     to https. (Too bad that there is no way to safely transfer credentials..)
   Votes:
     +1: rhuijben

 * r1550803
   Fix pool lifetime of variables in svn_client_commit_item3_t when duplicated.
   Justification:
     Pool lifetime issues are bad, and debugging them hard.
   Votes:
     +1: rhuijben, danielsh

 * r1551524, 1551579
   Fix an 'No Write Lock' error when moving files between externals and
   parent working copies or vice versa.
   Justification:
     svn move should just work in these cases.
   Votes:
     +1: rhuijben

 * r1553101, r1553105, r1553113
   Resolve performance regression in certain 'svn log' scenarios, especially
   against pre Subversion 1.5 servers.
   Justification:
     Easy fix for improving performance for everybody. More generic patch for
     old versions might be needed for other scenarios, but those scenarios
     were never supported on those old versions itself.
   Votes:
     +1: rhuijben

 * r1553376, r1553377
   Fix pool lifetime issue in serf commit processing for copied files and dirs
   Justification:
     Pool lifetime issues are bad. Reported by several git-svn users.
   Votes:
     +1: rhuijben

Veto-blocked changes:
=====================

 * r1524145
   Make the 'm' conflict prompt option run external merge tool if configured.
   Justification:
     Usability fix. The current behaviour ('m' -> internal merge tool,
     'l' -> external merge tool) confuses users who try 'm' to run an
     external merge tool. See issue #4426.
   Votes:
     +1: stsp
     -1: breser (see my email to dev@, <5282FE15.40505@reser.org>)

 * r1536854
   Make 'svnadmin verify' detect inconsistencies that will prevent loading
   dump files.
   Justification:
     Some users rely on dump files as a means of repository backup.  Without
     this patch, there is no way except of 'svnadmin load' to know that these
     dump files will load at all.  With this patch, a successful verify run
     should guarantee loadable dump files.
   Branch: ^/subversion/branches/1.8.x-r1536854
   Votes:
     +1: stefan2
     -1: breser (includes a --keep-going test which fails on 1.8.x since no
                 such option in 1.8.x)
