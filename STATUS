This file tracks the status of releases in the 1.7.x line.

See http://subversion.apache.org/docs/community-guide/releasing.html#release-stabilization
for details on how release lines and voting work, what kinds of bugs can
delay a release, etc.

Status of 1.7.0:

Candidate changes:
==================

 * r1146131 and followups
   Add svn_fs_verify() and implement rep-cache verification in FSFS using it.
   Branch:
     1.7.x-fs-verify
   Justification:
     Would be nice to extend verify already in 1.7.x.
   Notes:
     This does not include progress reporting, since that is nominated
     separately.
   Votes:
     +1: rhuijben
     +0: danielsh
     +0: gstein (progress would be nice)

 * fs-progress branch
   Notes:
     Depends on the r1146131 group (1.7.x-fs-verify).
   Branch:
     fs-progress
   Justification:
     Provide feedback during 'svnadmin verify'.
     Avoid an API change in 1.8.
   Notes:
     If this proposal passes, the docstrings @since would have to be fixed
     in a new commit.
   Votes:
     +0: danielsh

 * r1147540, r1147541
   Remove unused variables in build system.
   Justification:
     Backporting of future changes will be easier.
   Votes:
     +1: arfrever
     -0: stsp (we can backport these when we need to)

 * r1148083, r1148094
   Preload libsvn_auth_gnome_keyring and libsvn_auth_kwallet in locally built
   executables.
   Justification:
     Version mismatch errors would occur during trying to use locally built
     executables when a different version of Subversion was installed
     in /usr/lib.
   Votes:
     +1: arfrever, philip

 * r1154278, r1154379, r1154382
   Make 'svn ls' capable of listing Subversion 1.0-1.3 repositories using
   ra_serf.
   Justification:
     We promised not to break backwards compatibility and it is not nice
     that serf doesn't want to list the neon repository.
     (Check svn ls http://svn.webdav.org/repos/projects/neon/)
   Notes:
     r1154278 is a quick hack to detect old servers and to at least return
              some information.
     r1154379 is the real fix: fallback to a more compatible request.
     r1154382 makes sure the right result is used directly after falling
              back from svn_ra_serf__get_dir.
              (Most likely the problem is detected earlier than this function)
   Votes:
     +1: rhuijben

 * r1155160
   When serf restarts a web request, start parsing xml where we stopped in the
   previous request to avoid xml parse errors on the <?xml.
   Justification:
     Without this patch it is not possible to reliable checkout neon using
     serf. (svn co http://svn.webdav.org/repos/projects/neon/tags/0.29.6 wc).
     I (rhuijben) call that a regression.
   Branch:
     ^/subversion/branches/1.7.x-r1155160
   Votes:
     +1: rhuijben, stsp
     +1: cmpilato (Without branch: Change looks good, but there is a
                   merge conflict. Please create a backport branch.)

 * r1158187, r1158196, r1158201, r1158207
   Fix issues #2557 and #3987: 'svn info symlink/to/wc'.
   Justification:
     That syntax should work.
   Notes:
     Depends on the r1158193 group.
   Votes:
     +1: danielsh (without r1158187)
     +1: rhuijben, cmpilato

 * r1158616
   Recreate missing directories on file install errors.
   Justification:
     Trivial patch that fixes a variable reference in a patch that should have
     handled a common user problem. The result is improved the svn cleanup
     stability.
   Votes:
     +1: rhuijben, cmpilato

 * r1158196, r1158201, r1158207, r1158209, r1158210, r1158217
   Fix another variant of issues #2557 and #3987: 'svnversion symlink/to/wc'.
   Justification:
     That syntax should work.
   Notes:
     r1158196, r1158201, r1158207 adds (and tweaks) the test for tis problem.
   Votes:
     +1: rhuijben, danielsh
     +1 (r1158209, r1158210, r1158217): cmpilato

 * r1158407, r1158419, r1158854
   Fix issue #3989 'merge which deletes file with native eol-style raises
     spurious tree conflict'.
   Justification:
     Fixes a regression from 1.6.x in a common merge use case.
   Notes:
     r1158407 and r1158419 are the test, r1158854 is the fix.
   Votes:
     +1: pburba

 * r1158893
   Make sure that serf doesn't insert a final '\0' in a property value
   retrieved via svn_ra_get_file_revs().
   Justification:
     Unbreaks annotate in AnkhSVN when using serf. (See log message for
     details). svn's blame receiver doesn't notice any problems as it just
     assumes that the interesting property values are valid cstrings.
   Votes:
     +1: rhuijben, hwright

Veto-blocked changes:
=====================

 * r1148992
   Print error messages about failures of dynamic loading of libraries when
   SVN_DEBUG_DSO is defined instead of never.
   Justification:
     Suboptimal r1148374 was already backported in r1148488.
   Votes:
     +1: arfrever
     -1: rhuijben (A library shouldn't just write things to stderr. This needs
                   proper error handling instead. And besides I doubt anyone is
                   going to use this define (Soft veto. Feel free to -0 when the
                   problems are resolved))
     -0: philip (changed my mind, I don't think this is needed on the branch)
     -0: stsp (Arfrever, can you please explain precisely what use case you
               have for this code? Why do you need it in the release, or
               on trunk, for that matter?)
