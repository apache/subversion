Status of 1.7.6:

Candidate changes:
==================

 * r1306275, and too many other revisions to list here
   New diff support code for added/deleted files and directories.
   Fixes issue #4153, "svn log --diff" on moved file gives "not found",
   and other problems.
   Justification:
     The current code (introduced in 1.7.x in the r1207351 backport commit)
     produces inconsistent paths in diff output (see
     http://svn.haxx.se/dev/archive-2012-03/0385.shtml), and it also breaks
     with the paradigm that the target of an editor drive may never have more
     than one path component (which according to cmpilato is an API violation).
   Notes:
     Please read the branch and related trunk log messages for detailed notes
     about these changes.
   Branch:
     ^/subversion/branches/1.7.x-issue4153
   Votes:
     +1: stsp

 * ^/subversion/branches/1.7.x-performance
   Use the working copy status walker as a first filter to find committable
   nodes.
   Justification:
     Huge performance boost. Especially on NFS.
   Notes:
     Backports the status walker framework. Many other parts are backportable
     too, but this branch delivers the plumbing.
   Votes:
     +0: rhuijben (I would like to see some test results before backporting)

 * r1341060
   Sort output of 'svn import'
   Notes: Needs a backport branch, noted here for completeness.
   Votes:
     +0: stsp (pending a proper conflict-free backport)
     -0: julianfoad (Nice behaviour enhancement but what's the justification
            for back-porting this on its own without similar for other
            commands?  The log msg says it was done to maintain stable output
            with APR 1.4.6 random hash order, but it wasn't stable before
            that because the order the directory entries were read into the
            hash, and so the order of multiple keys in one bucket, was not
            controlled.)

 * r1368662
   Add information about the build system to 'svn --version' output.
   Justification:
      Makes solving user problems a little bit easier since the
      default 'svn --version' output contains the config.guess
      identification of the build system.
