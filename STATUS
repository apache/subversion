Candidate changes:
==================

 * r1701488
   Issue #4592 "fix contrib check-mime-type.pl for changes to 'svnlook proplist'
     output", http://subversion.tigris.org/issues/show_bug.cgi?id=4592
   Justification:
     Make this contributed script work again, after 1.7.8 broke it.
   Notes:
     Brett Randall put effort into contributing this fix: see the dev@ email
     thread "[patch][reboot-topic] fix check-mime-type.pl for changes to
     'svnlook proplist' output" started by him on 2015-08-07, archived at
     e.g. <http://svn.haxx.se/dev/archive-2015-08/0047.shtml> or
     <http://mail-archives.apache.org/mod_mbox/subversion-dev/201508.mbox/%3CCALeEUB56NVCR0nCZ2rYki6oKQNcVPPLvWTeCoYyrMqitsov0ag@mail.gmail.com%3E>.

     +0: danielsh (not tested; would be nice to have a $ anchor in the pattern)

 * r1701598, r1701603, r1701611, r1701646
   Make 'svn lock' and 'svn unlock' report (un)lock errors as failure
   Justification:
     A single lock or unlock failure doesn't affect the whole operation
     since 1.9, but this has the side effect of no longer producing an
     error at all on failures. This patch makes 'svn' return an error when
     at least one failure is reported by the locking code.
   Notes:
     r1701598 is the actual fix. The other patches simplify and fix
     test expectations.

 * r1703581
   Allow simple resolving of binary file text conflicts
   Justification:
     Simple usability improvement. Use reported. Regression.

 * r1703688, 1703689
   Fix merging deletes of svn:eol-style CRLF or CR files
   Justification:
     Resolves unnecessary tree conflicts.
     Any more reasons needed? :-)

 * r1704292, r1704573
   Make svn diff --git produce proper forward binary diffs
   Justification:
     Applying accidental reverse diffs might work for git, but isn't
     going to work for our 1.10 'svn patch' implementation.
   Votes:
     +1: rhuijben

 * r1704847
   Report both built- and run-time versions of libserf, like we do for
   everything else.
   Justification:
     Easier debugging.	Consistency with version-reporting of other runtime
     dependencies.
