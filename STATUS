Status of 1.0.3:
================

Candidate changes:

  * r8867, r8868, r8902
    Trivial performance fix for mod_authz_svn; cache the access file per
    connection instead of reloading it per request.
    Justification: Saves at least 2 loads of the access file per update, plus
    an additional number of times equal to the number of entries in the REPORT
    response.
    Notes: Similar code has been present in mod_dav_svn to cache an open
    filesystem per connection.

      -0: kfogel  (Reviewed the change; it's not *so* trivial, and I'm
                   not sure an optimization like this belongs in a
                   patch release.)

  * r9003
    Include the path to the directory containing libsvn_swig_java in
    SWIG_JAVA_LINK to allow the SWIG Java bindings to actually build.
    Justification: It is not possible to build the SWIG Java bindings
    without this fix.

  * r9315
    Change the formating codes used in svn_swig_pl_callback_thunk.

    Update many references to neon 0.24.5.

  * r9589
    Fix nasty pool usage problems in 'svnlook diff/changed/dirs-changed'.
    Justification: commit-email.pl uses 'svnlook diff', and 'svnlook
    diff' on, say, and large import, can get *really* nasty memory-wise.

  * r9667
    Fix potential attack path in pre-commit-hook template.
    Justification: Don't offer templates we don't want to use ourselves.

  * r9720,r9727
    Fix problem with javahl bindings which triggers a java.lang.NoSuchMethodError
    exception and problems where the callback from C calls the wrong java method.
    The second problem can lead to a crash of the java virtual machine.
    Justification: Bindings only changes, where the wrong java interfaces
    is referenced. Without it a crash can happen.
