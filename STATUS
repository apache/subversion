  * r14063, r14066, r14067 (partial), r14068, r14079, r14121, r14124, r14156
    Branch: 1.2.x-r14063
    Fix FSFS locking problem.
    Justification:
      Issue #2265 can cause data loss.
    Notes:
      Only the svnserve.c part of r14067 (add calls to
      svn_fs_initialize) is merged, since only that program can be
      threaded, and adding svn_fs_initialize calls to clients runs
      afoul of --enable-dso.

      +1: ghudson

  * r14177
    Add svn_ra_initialize() API.
    Justification:
      We can't add this in 1.3 and require it being called.
    Votes:
      +1: lundblad

  * r14183
    Fix crash in the javahl bindings from use of the Notify2 interface.

      Small javahl binding-only fix to prevent crash of Java VM.

  * r14205, 14208
