delay a release, etc.

================

  * r20041
    Get rid of requirement for another RPM package (chrpath) to build the
    Linux RPM packages.
    Justification:
      Using Fedora Core as an example, I figured out a better
      way to simplify build package requirements with patch instead of
      package.

    Fix a segmentation fault when an error occurs in log message callback
    in the Ruby bindings.

Veto-blocked changes:

  * r17333 and associated test case (copied from trunk)
    Fix issue #2306: modification of "svn:needs-lock" should adjust
    the native file system's read-only attribute within a WC.
    Branch: 1.3.x-r17333
      (This branch was removed from HEAD in r33133.)
    Justification:
      Backport of a change to trunk which resolves buggy behavior on
      Windows, behavior which is inconsistent with Linux.
    Notes:
      dlr does not have a Windows development environment, and thus
      cannot adequately test this change.  Additional testing is
      especially important given the heavy amount of modification
      which was necessary when backporting the change from trunk.
