This file tracks the status of releases in the 1.7.x line.

See http://subversion.apache.org/docs/community-guide/releasing.html#release-stabilization
for details on how release lines and voting work, what kinds of bugs can
delay a release, etc.

Status of 1.7.1:

Candidate changes:
==================

 * r1146131 and followups
   Add svn_fs_verify() and implement rep-cache verification in FSFS using it.
   Branch:
     1.7.x-fs-verify
   Justification:
     Would be nice to extend verify already in 1.7.x.
   Notes:
     This does not include progress reporting; that has been postponed to 1.8.
   Conflicts:
     On fs_fs.c.  Resolve with 'theirs-conflict'.
   Votes:
     +1: danielsh, rhuijben
     +0: gstein (progress would be nice) (without r1161164, r1161180)
     -0: cmpilato (For a function with this name, the implementation is far
         too anemic. I'd prefer this be a private function in 1.7.x, leaving
         room for a future public API that really does full verification.)
         (without r1161164, r1161180)

 * r1147540, r1147541
   Remove unused variables in build system.
   Justification:
     Backporting of future changes will be easier.
   Votes:
     +1: arfrever
     -0: stsp (we can backport these when we need to)
     -0: gstein

 * r1185746, r1186059
   Fix up some erroneous "Could not frob some targets because..." warnings.
   Votes:
     +1: stsp

 * r1185738, r1185763, r1185768, r1185886
   Add support for upgrading absent nodes to the wonderfull wc-ng world.
   Justification:
     This should have been part of 1.7.0. Without this patch it is impossible
     to upgrade working copies with server excluded/absent directories.
   Notes:
     r1185738, r1185763, r1185768: adds a test for this problem.
     r1185886: fixes this issue and cleans up whitespace in the test.
   Votes:
     +1: rhuijben

 * r1185911, r1185918
   Fix reporting of depth empty directories
   Justification:
     Without this patch 'svn update' sometimes tries to apply updates to nodes
     that don't exist locally.
     (1.6 received the same nodes but filtered the incoming data before
      applying it to the working copy)
   Notes:
     r1185911 adds a simple test for this case and r1185918 resolves this
     regression.
   Votes:
     +1: rhuijben
