Status of 1.1.5:
================

Candidate changes that seem to have become stalled
due to persistent lack of votes:

  * r12075, r12448
    Add pre-0.14 dumpfile compatability.
    Justification: Some very old clients were recently spotted in
    the wild.  And: Dumpfile compatibility is always good.
    Notes: These look good to me, but are complex enough that I'm not
      comfortable +1'ing without testing on an old dumpfile, and I
      haven't done that yet.  -kfogel

      -0: ringstrom (because the patch is non-trivial and there is only a
                     single known pre-0.14 user)
      -0: ghudson (not really comfortable having this code in the trunk,
                   much less 1.1; dumpfile compatibility in general
                   good, pre-0.14 compatibility not so important)

Candidate changes:

  * r13715,r13861
    Make use of new swig-1.3.19-3 which allows swig 1.3.19 to co-exist with
    swig-1.1p5 package that comes with Redhat.
    Justification: Less hassle for software developers because packages
      co-exist.

    When I finally got to test my change I discovered a typo which prevents
    the Redhat 8 and 9 RPMs from being built.
