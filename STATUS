This file tracks the status of releases in the 1.5.x line.

See "Stabilizing and maintaining releases" in trunk/www/hacking.html for
details on how release lines and voting work, what kinds of bugs can
delay a release, etc.

Status of 1.5.0:
================

Candidate changes:

 * r30666, r30684, r30726
   ra_neon: Cache repository UUID / ra_*: Have update check that it matches.
   Notes: Not strictly necessary for 1.5.0, but would be nice to get
     the new svn_ra_open3() API in if we can.  If we do backport,
     make sure to change "New in 1.6" to "New in 1.5", of course.
     r30726 is a trivial compiler-warning change, by the way.
