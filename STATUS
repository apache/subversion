Status of 1.7.3:

Candidate changes:
==================

 * r1147540, r1147541
   Remove unused variables in build system.
   Justification:
     Backporting of future changes will be easier.
   Votes:
     +1: arfrever
     -0: stsp (we can backport these when we need to)
     -0: gstein

 * r1201072, r1205188, r1205209
   Fix issue #4050 "'svn mergeinfo' always considers non-inheritable ranges
   as partially merged".
   Justification:
     'svn mergeinfo' gave incorrect answers in what is admittedly an edge
     case, but the fix is very simple.
   Notes:
     r1201072 and r1205188 are a new test and minor tweak respectively.
     r1205209 is the fix.
   Votes:
     +1: pburba

 * r1207555, r1207808
   mod_dontdothat: contrib/ -> tools/ and relicense under ALv2.
   Justification:
     ASF infra is using this so we should maintain it.
     Stuff in contrib/ isn't officially maintained.
   Notes:
     r1207555: Perform the move (from r1207550) and relicense
     r1207808: Enable building mod_dontdothat from our standard make scripts.
   Votes:
     +1: rhuijben, stsp

 * r1150344, r1158923, r1158929, r1166267, r1206576, r1206718, r1206719,
   r1206724, r1206741, r1207656, r1207663, r1207823
   Fix issues #3814, and #3991, and other EOL-handling problems in patch.
   Justification:
     svn patch is broken for file content and property values not terminated
     with EOL, and for patches not terminated with EOL.
     Fixes requested on users@:
     http://svn.haxx.se/users/archive-2011-11/0513.shtml
     http://svn.haxx.se/users/archive-2011-11/0523.shtml

     r1207663: Fix handling of '\ No newline ...' comments within hunk text.

   Branch:
     ^/subversion/branches/1.7.x-svn-patch-eol-fixes
   Votes:
     +1: stsp, philip

 * r1207858, r1207949
   Replace two assertions that say that your working copy is broken with
   error messages that supply a bit more information about what is broken.
   Votes:
     +1: philip, rhuijben

 * r1210195
   Canonicalize svnserve.conf input.
   Justification:
     Server asserts after being upgraded.
   Votes:
     +1: danielsh, philip

 * r1210147, r1202132, r1202333
   Fix the 'svn log --diff' code so that it correctly shows a diff of a
   target file (or directory) that was at a different path in the past.
   Previously it would error out. A test is included.
   Branch:
     ^/subversion/branches/1.7.x-r1210147
   Notes:
    r1210147 is the actual fix.
    r1202132 and r1202333 were merged for conflict resolution. These revisions
    depend on the issue #2873 fix which has been backported in 1.7.2
   Votes:
     +1: stsp
     +1: julianfoad (r1210147 only)

 * r1211483
   Don't segfault on 'svn mkdir svn://localhost'
   Justification:
     Thou shall not segfault.
   Votes:
     +1: rhuijben, philip

 * r1154121, r1195480, r1208840, r1209631, r1209654, r1212476, r1212482,
   r1212484
   Update and clarify the merge help text.
   Justification:
     Merge usage questions are very frequently asked questions in #svn IRC and
     on the users@ list. We should improve the documentation whenever we can
     and point people to it.
   Notes:
     Merge with --accept=theirs-conflict
   Votes:
     +1: stsp

 * r1213331
   Prune younger-than-youngest revisions from rep-cache.db.
   Justification:
     If this case actually materializes, this patch fixes a lurking filesystem
     corruption.
   Votes:
     +1: danielsh

Veto-blocked changes:
=====================

 * r1146131 and followups
   Add svn_fs_verify() and implement rep-cache verification in FSFS using it.
   Branch:
     1.7.x-fs-verify
   Justification:
     Would be nice to extend verify already in 1.7.x.
   Notes:
     This does not include progress reporting; that has been postponed to 1.8.
   Conflicts:
     On fs_fs.c.  Resolve with 'theirs-conflict'.
   Votes:
     +1: danielsh, rhuijben
     +0: gstein (progress would be nice) (without r1161164, r1161180)
     -0: cmpilato (For a function with this name, the implementation is far
         too anemic. I'd prefer this be a private function in 1.7.x, leaving
         room for a future public API that really does full verification.)
         (without r1161164, r1161180)
     -1: danielsh (invasive, new feature)

Approved changes:
=================

 * r1211859, r1211885
   Fix issue 4074, SEGV on "svn rm ROOT_URL"
   Justification:
     It's a SEGV.
   Votes:
     +1: philip, rhuijben, steveking
