Status of 1.7.7:

Candidate changes:
==================

 * r1374800, r1374802, r1389364
   Fix issues with applying Git patch files.
   Justification:
     It's a small change, and it allows applying patches that failed
     before.
   Votes:
     +1 (without r1389364): steveking, rhuijben
     +1: stsp, cmpilato

 * r1242759, r1242770, r1242794, r1380175
   Fix various issues with GNOME and KDE keyring providers, especially
   as regards how their interact with --non-interactive mode.  Fixes
   issues #4110 ("kwallet not used with --non-interactive") and #4112
   ("gnome keyring --non-interactive fail with password on disk").
   Justification:
     Fixes user-reported problem which significantly limits
     usabilility in certain environments.
   Branch:
     ^/subversion/branches/1.7.x-r1242759 
   Votes:
     +1: philip, cmpilato

 * r1306275, and too many other revisions to list here
   New diff support code for added/deleted files and directories.
   Fixes issue #4153, "svn log --diff" on moved file gives "not found",
   and other problems.
   Justification:
     The current code (introduced in 1.7.x in the r1207351 backport commit)
     produces inconsistent paths in diff output (see
     http://svn.haxx.se/dev/archive-2012-03/0385.shtml), and it also breaks
     with the paradigm that the target of an editor drive may never have more
     than one path component (which according to cmpilato is an API violation).
   Notes:
     Please read the branch and related trunk log messages for detailed notes
     about these changes.
   Branch:
     ^/subversion/branches/1.7.x-issue4153
   Votes:
     +1: stsp

 * ^/subversion/branches/1.7.x-commit-performance
   r1337118, r1337281, r1337374, r1337377, r1337392, r1337394, r1337485
   Use the working copy status walker as a first filter to find committable
   nodes.
   Justification:
     Huge performance boost. Especially on NFS.
   Notes:
     Backports the status walker framework. Many other parts are backportable
     too, but this branch delivers the plumbing.
     [JAF] We might want to include some of the subsequent updates to this
           code, such as: r1337403, r1337475, r1337736, r1338059, r1338338.
   Votes:
     +0: rhuijben (I would like to see some test results before backporting)

 * r1341060
   Sort output of 'svn import'
   Notes: Needs a backport branch, noted here for completeness.
   Votes:
     +0: stsp (pending a proper conflict-free backport)
     -0: julianfoad (Nice behaviour enhancement but what's the justification
            for back-porting this on its own without similar for other
            commands?  The log msg says it was done to maintain stable output
            with APR 1.4.6 random hash order, but it wasn't stable before
            that because the order the directory entries were read into the
            hash, and so the order of multiple keys in one bucket, was not
            controlled.)

 * r1368662, r1370526, r1370557, r1370801
   Add information about the build system to 'svn --version' output.
   Justification:
     Makes solving user problems a little bit easier since the
     default 'svn --version' output contains the config.guess
     identification of the build system.
   Votes:
     +1: brane
     +1 (only r1368662): steveking

 * r1374198
   Remove mod_dontdothat from install-tools so that configurations
   --without-apxs will not try to build it.
   Justification:
     Fixes regression from 1.7.5.
   Notes:
     Reverts backport of r1307177 because that caused builds to fail
     when Apache headers and libraries were not present. Trunk has a
     followup in r1374357 that reinstates the desired behaviour.
   Votes:
     +1: brane
     =0: danielsh (does this move mod_dontdothat to 'make install'?
                   perhaps we should special case it (new "dontdothat" value
		   for the build.conf install=... attribute) for the stable
                   branch?)

 * r1174342
   Fix issue 4016, make status descend into dir externals after upgrade.
   Justification:
     Status doesn't work properly after upgrade.
   Votes:
     +1: philip

 * r1365592
   Fix issue 4224, file externals don't update with old mod_dav_svn
   Justification:
     Backward compatibility using 1.7 clients with old servers.
   Votes:
     +1: philip, rhuijben

 * r1380295
   Make sure a proper revision or SVN_INVALID_REVNUM is returned as the
   result of svn_client_update4() when not performing a real update.
   Justification:
     Implement api properly.
   Votes:
     +1: rhuijben, philip

 * r1344864, r1344865, r1344869
   Sort list of deleted paths in dump file output. See issue #4134.
   Justification:
     Reproducible output with APR 1.4.6.
   Notes:
     Merge with --accept=tc.
   Votes:
     +1: stsp

 * r1365519, r1383029, r1383483
   Fix assertions in ra_serf triggered when communicating with a
   repository hosted at the server root URL.
   Justification:
     Assertions tell us that stuff is wrong.  Very wrong.
   Notes:
     r1365519: renames variables; dups a string into the session pool
     r1383029: fixes svn_ra_serf__reparent to avoid NULL url.path
     r1383483: fixes a couple of other NULL url.path instances
   Branch:
     ^/subversion/branches/1.7.x-serf-server-root-segfaults
   Votes:
     +1: cmpilato, rhuijben

 * r1387226
   Fix issue 4231, mod_dav_svn assert with SVNAutoVersioning and <Location />
   Justification:
     It's an assert.
   Votes:
     +1: philip, rhuijben

 * r1389499
   Fix several test failures when running 1.7.x tests within a format 30 WC.
   Justification:
     Spurious test failures are bad, allows 1.7 checkout nested in 1.8 wc.
   Votes:
     +1: stsp, philip

 * r1389851
   Fix commit from multiple working copies nested within a parent WC.
   Justification:
     Prevents error when trying commit from multiple nested WCs.
     Fixes a test failure on 1.7.x when run within a format 30 WC.
   Branch:
     ^/subversion/branches/1.7.x-r1389851
   Votes:
     +1: stsp

 * r1387943
   Fix unbounded memory use with SVNPathAuthz short_circuit.
   Justification:
     Server process may abort if memory exhausted.
   Votes:
     +1: philip, ivan

 * r1389878
   Fix working copy access via symlink to WC nested within a format 30 WC.
   Justification:
     Fixes two test failures on 1.7.x when run within a format 30 WC.
   Notes:
     Depends on r1389499 backport for passing tests.
   Branch:
     ^/subversion/branches/1.7.x-r1389878
   Votes:
     +1: stsp

 * r1389928
   Fix a 1.7.x test to pass within a format 30 working copy.
   Justification:
     Convenience for users of trunk clients.
   Branch:
     ^/subversion/branches/1.7.x-r1389928
   Votes:
     +1: stsp

 * r1389658
   Fix the Perl bindings building with newer versions of SWIG. 
   Justification:
     Convenience for users using newer verisons of SWIG.
   Votes:
     +1: breser

 * r1391020, r1391022
   Fix issue #4234, "svndumpfilter exclude --targets wants pathname to
   start with '/'"
   Justification:
     Fixes inconsistent parameter processing. Paths specified on the command
     line and via --targets file should be handled the same way.
   Notes:
     Test added by r1391022 depends on r1389499 backport to PASS in 1.8 WC.
   Votes:
     +1: stsp

 * r1390965
   Avoid claiming all tests pass when most fail to run.
   Justification:
     Summary should be accurate.
   Votes:
     +1: philip
