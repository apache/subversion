Candidate changes for 1.5.1:
============================

 * r31313
   Make all ra layers return a consistent error when a path is not found in the
   repository.
   Notes:
     Small change, but API consistency is always a good thing.
     Does not merge cleanly!
   Votes:
     +1: lgo, cmpilato
     -0: markphip (serf tests fail on OSX), epg (failure confirmed)

 * r31196, r31199, r31280, r31283, r31287
   Don't commit an add of a missing item (issue #3198).
   Notes:
     r31199 is a trivial followup that adds a missing SVN_ERR() wrap.
     r31280, r31283 and r31287 add a regression test.
   Votes:
     +1: kfogel (r31196 and r31199 only)
     +0: danielsh
     +1: lgo

 * r30748
   Don't try to drive the merge editor when there is nothing to be merged.
   Justification:
     I didn't originally nominate this for backport as I couldn't
     demonstrate any problem with it on trunk.  But the new merge test in
     the r31059 group ("don't explicitly record implicit mergeinfo") does fail
     without it and thus neatly demonstrates why this change is needed.
   Votes:
     +1: pburba, markphip

 * r31059, r31060, r31061, r31075, r31151, r31398, and r31482
   Fix issue #3157, Merging a change from a path's natural history
   creates self-referential mergeinfo
   Notes:
     r31075, r31151, and r31482 are the core fixes for the issue, the other
     revisions are a new test for it (and a few minor follow-ups to that
     test).  The addition of the new merge test in r31059 and the removal of
     an XFail in the test list in r31075 trivally conflicts because several
     other new merge tests are not backported yet.  r31482 conflicts in the
     comment for merge.c's filter_natural_history_from_mergeinfo, again this
     is fairly trivial to resolve.  This fix is dependent on r30748.
   Votes:
     +1: pburba
     +1: cmpilato, markphip (all except r31398 and 31482)

 * r31300, r31301, r31312
   Fix issue #3199, subtree merges broken when required ranges don't
   intersect with merge target.
   Justification:
     A bit of an edge case, but when it is encountered merge silently
     fails to do the correct merge but sets mergeinfo as if it did.
   Notes:
     r31300 is a test for this issue, r31301 fixes the core problem where
     the part of the merge was skipped, and r31312 fixes a problem with
     merge notification.
   Votes:
     +1: pburba

 * r31425, r31722
   Support the 'http-library' option when Subversion was configured
   with the '--enable-runtime-module-search' option.
   Votes:
     +1: arfrever

 * r31504
   Optimize file merges performed with ancestrally related sources by
   using the svn_ra_get_log2() interface to figure out in which revisions
   the source really changed, and using that information to filter out
   no-op revision ranges prior to merging.
   Votes:
     +1: cmpilato

 * r30632, r30749, r31757, r31769, r31817
   Fix issue #3174, 'Merge algorithm chokes on subtrees needing special
   attention that have been renamed'
   Justification:
     File merges that encounter this problem break, the fix is fairly simple,
     and directory merges already have the equivalent fix in 1.5.0.
   Notes:
     r31817 is the core fix for the issue, the other revision relate to
     a new test and some subsequent tweaks for to it.  r30749 conflicts
     trivally in the merge_tests.py test list.
   Votes:
     +1: pburba

 * r31820
   Performance improvements for BDB-backed repository post-commit
   deltification.
   Votes:
     +1: cmpilato

 * r31737
   Fix compilation error in JavaHL on Windows x64.
   Justification:
     Small fix, user-report error.
   Votes:
     +1: hwright

 * r31825
   Don't reset LDFLAGS when the '--with-zlib' option was passed to configure.
   Votes:
     +1: arfrever, blair

 * r31833
   svndumpfilter: Don't match prefixes to partial path components. Fixes #desc4
   of issue #1853.
   Notes:
	 Was originally committed to the svnpatch-diff branch in r31831, and
	 then merged to trunk as r31833.
