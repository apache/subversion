This file tracks the status of releases in the 1.6.x line.

See "Stabilizing and maintaining releases" in trunk/www/hacking.html for
details on how release lines and voting work, what kinds of bugs can

Status of 1.6.4:
================

Candidate changes:

 * r36720
   Fix building with Apache 2.4.
   Votes:
     +1: arfrever

 * r37478, r37543, r37544, r37545, r37547
   Support using `svnversion` on files and improve some messages printed by
   `svnversion`.
   Justification:
     Some messages printed by `svnversion` are inconsistent and sometimes
     incorrect:
     $ svnversion /usr
     exported
     $ svnversion /bin/ls
     '/bin/ls' not versioned, and not exported
     $ svnversion VERSIONED_FILE
     'VERSIONED_FILE' not versioned, and not exported
     $ svnversion /nonexistent
     subversion/libsvn_wc/questions.c:90: (apr_err=2)
     svn: '/nonexistent' does not exist
     ^^^
     Messages with these revisions backported:
     $ svnversion /usr
     Unversioned directory
     $ svnversion /bin/ls
     Unversioned file
     $ svnversion VERSIONED_FILE
     NUMBER
     $ svnversion /nonexistent
     '/nonexistent' doesn't exist
   Votes:
     +1: arfrever
     -0: rhuijben, cmpilato (Introduces new features and changes output)

 * r37988
   Fix issue #3416, "Cannot add or commit 'dir/@file.txt'"
   Justification:
     Makes Subversion's behaviour regarding peg-revision parsing
     consistent with what The Book describes, and makes all subcommands
     properly deal with filenames starting with the '@' character.
   Notes:
     Doesn't merge cleanly (two tree conflicts), and needed an API
     change for backport. Backport branch is at ^/branches/1.6.x-r37988
   Votes:
     +1: stsp

 * r38004, r38014, r38028, r38122
   Make KWallet window attached to terminal window.
   Justification:
     Without this change, KWallet window can appear behind terminal window
     and is left after killing terminal.
   Votes:
     +1: arfrever
     -0: psamuelson, stsp (without r38122) (code is ugly and Linux-specific -
                                            would getenv("WINDOWID") work instead?)

 * r38101, r38102
   Fix a bug that causes locking to fail over ra-neon if the user provides
   a lock comment that has XML-special characters in it.
   Justification:
     Bugfixes are what maintenance releases are for.  Ya dig?
   Votes:
     +1: cmpilato, rhuijben

 * r38166, r38168
   Fix issue #2580, svn+ssh SIGKILLs ssh processes
   Justification:
     Without this fix, svn+ssh:// does not play nicely with ssh
     connection pooling.
   Notes:
     See the issue for (an overwhelming amount of) details.
