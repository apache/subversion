Status of 1.6.3:
================

Candidate changes:

 * r37478, r37543, r37544, r37545, r37547
   Support using `svnversion` on files and improve some messages printed by
   `svnversion`.
   Justification:
     Some messages printed by `svnversion` are inconsistent and sometimes
     incorrect:
     $ svnversion /usr
     exported
     $ svnversion /bin/ls
     '/bin/ls' not versioned, and not exported
     $ svnversion VERSIONED_FILE
     'VERSIONED_FILE' not versioned, and not exported
     $ svnversion /nonexistent
     subversion/libsvn_wc/questions.c:90: (apr_err=2)
     svn: '/nonexistent' does not exist
     ^^^
     Messages with these revisions backported:
     $ svnversion /usr
     Unversioned directory
     $ svnversion /bin/ls
     Unversioned file
     $ svnversion VERSIONED_FILE
     NUMBER
     $ svnversion /nonexistent
     '/nonexistent' doesn't exist

 * r37827
   If the configure script check for bindtextdomain() in libintl fails,
   try again with -liconv.
   Justification:
     Fixes NLS support detection at least on OpenBSD, and maybe more systems.
   Notes:
     I patched this bug ages ago for the OpenBSD Subversion package
     but never committed a fix for it here (my bad).

 * r37931
   Stop propagation of self-referential mergeinfo via --reintegrate merges.
   Justification:
     In some use cases can lead to seriously broken merges as it appears
     some merges have been performed which have not and others have not
     which have.  Sorta defeats the purpose of merge tracking...

 * r37939
   Fix a segfault in r37795 and add regression test.
   Justification:
     This segfault already is in 1.6.x. That's when svnsync tries to sync
     the deletion of an svn:prop. People would positively go mad.
   Votes:
     +1: neels

 * r37941
   Bump apr and apr-util versions included in deps to latest.
   Justification:
     apr-util 1.3.7 fixes a potential DoS flaw in mod_dav_svn.  Exploit is
     in the wild, and although we don't need to update the scripts on the
     branch, it'd be kinda nice.
