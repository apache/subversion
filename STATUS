This file tracks the status of changes proposed for inclusion in 1.0.
Each candidate consists of a short identifying block (e.g., a revision
number, maybe an issue number), a brief description of the change, and
an at-most-one-line justification of why it should be in 1.0, followed
by the votes.  For example:

   * r98765 (issue #56789)
     Use an opaque type for svn_ra_get_ansible(), instead of void *.
     Justification: API stability
     Notes:
      See http://... regarding veto.
     Votes:
       +1: ghudson, bliss
       -1: jerenkrantz

A change needs three +1 votes from full committers (or partial committers
with access to the involved paths), and no vetoes, to go into the release.

If you cast a veto (i.e. -1), then please include a link to a mailing
list thread explaining your veto.  You can go back and add the link
later if the thread isn't available at the time you commit the veto.

Voting +1 on a change doesn't just mean you approve of it in principle.
It means you have thoroughly reviewed the change, and find it correct
and as nondisruptive as possible.  When it is committed to the release
branch, the log message will include the names of all who voted for
it, as well as the original author and the person making the commit.
All of these people are considered equally answerable for bugs.

Thursday, Jan. 8th, 2004 is the deadline for candidate changes to be
voted on.  The sooner a change is listed, the more time people have to
review and vote.  (Obviously, emergency bugs can be reported, fixed,
and voted on at any time -- this deadline is for changes that we
already know about.)
