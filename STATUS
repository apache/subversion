     +1: brane, stsp

 * r1850651
   Fix a use-after-free in mod_dav_svn's logging of FS warnings.

     Lots of crashes on OpenBSD during 'make check' with HTTPD 2.4.
     See https://svn.haxx.se/dev/archive-2018-12/0137.shtml

     +1: stsp, brane

 * r1851920
   Remove a useless common ancestor search from the conflict resolver.
   Justification:
     Current behaviour is inefficient and could lead to dubious conflicts.
   Votes:
     +1: stsp

 * r1852013
   Fix issue #4804: avoid test failures just because some SQLite compile-time
   feature was enabled that changes its query plan descriptions.
   Justification:
     Reported build failure on Gentoo Linux, see:
     https://bugs.gentoo.org/605438
   Votes:
     +1: brane, stsp

 * r1852436
   Make 'svn update' not record a tree conflict when deleting an unmodified
   directory which happens to contain unversioned items.
   Justification:
     Unnecessary tree conflict due to e.g. build artifacts on disk.
     User complained: https://svn.haxx.se/users/archive-2019-01/0060.shtml
     IRC discussion:

 * r1853450
   Enable 'incoming_move_file_merge' option only if local change is file edit.
   Justification:
     Conflict resolver misbehaves when it runs into move vs move conflicts.
   Votes:
     +1: stsp

 * r1853483
   Fix #4760 "Missing children when svnadmin dump --include/exclude converts
   copy-dir to add-dir".
   Justification:
     The new feature was broken.
   Votes:
     +1: julianfoad, stsp

 * r1854072, r1854074, r1854216
   Fix issue #4806: Remove on-disk trees with read-only directories in them.
   Justification:
     Fixes an edge case in our tree removal code. If we clear read-only
     permissions on files in order to remove them, we should do the same for
     directories.
   Votes:
     +1: brane, stsp

=====================

=================
