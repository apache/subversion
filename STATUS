This file tracks the status of releases in the 1.4.x line.

See "Stabilizing and maintaining releases" in trunk/www/hacking.html for
details on how release lines and voting work, what kinds of bugs can
delay a release, etc.

NOTE:  This branch uses svnmerge.py for merge tracking.  Please familiarize
yourself with that tool if you plan to actually merge changes here.

For example, to merge a number of revisions from trunk into branch,
you can use the svnmerge.py script that is in the branch.

$ contrib/client-side/svnmerge.py merge -r 21000-21006,21008,21876
$ svn diff
$ svn commit

Do not run svnmerge.py N separate times for each revision to merge
over, since svnmerge.py will not merge into a WC with uncommitted
changes.

Status of 1.4.4:
================

Candidate changes:

  * r21531, r21848, r21934
    Allow HTTP auth protocols to be configurable by way of a
    "http-auth-types" parameter.
    Justification:
      Allow GSSAPI/SSPI auth to be enabled/disabled on Windows with
      Neon 0.26.1+, addressesing numerous bug reports from
      TortoiseSVN, Subversion, Subclipse, etc.

      +1: dlr, djh, jerenkrantz
      -1: cmpilato (new features showing up in patch releases?  nuh-uh.)

  * r21885, r22076
    Add a new RPM package for the AuroraLinux 2.0 SPARC distribution.
    Justification:
      It is a combination of RHEL3 and RHEL4 distributions with
      characteristics matching both, so we need a new directory.
    Branch: 1.4.x-r22076 (-r22079:HEAD)
    Votes:
      +1: dws
      -1: maxb (It appears that the auroralinux-2 directory has been based
                on an old version of the rhel-3 directory, pre-dating some
                of the difference-reduction work I did to try to minimize the
                unnecessary inconsistencies between the various distro
                flavours. Its introduction therefore represents a regression
                in the maintainability of the RPM packaging area as a whole.)

  * r19808-19810, r22853
    Synchronise license text and then bump copyright dates to 2007.
    Justification:
      It's 2007.
    Notes: We might want to wait until we actually merge something we
      originally committed in 2007, possibly hold until 1.4.4?
    Votes:
      +1: malcolm, dlr, hwright
      -1: jerenkrantz (This is an unnecessary change to backport.)

  * r23115,r23117-23118
    Fix issue 2700: commit of locked file fails when no write access on root
    Justification:
      Fix for bug reported a few times on dev&users, includes test.
    Branch: 1.4.x-issue-2700 (-r23124:HEAD)
    Votes:
      +1: lgo
      +0: dlr

  * r23191, r23193, r23195, r23200
    Fix attempts to export a nonexistent URL to return an error,
    instead of reporting a successful export.
    Justification:
      Apparently a common user error.
    Votes:
      +1: dlr, hwright

  * r21453, r23468
    Fix regression causing updates of replaced files without history to fail.
    Justification:
      Annoying regression.
    Note:
      r21453 is a harmless refactoring in the test suite on which r23468
      depends.
    Branch:
      1.4.x-r23468
    Votes:
      +1: lundblad, dlr

  * r23491, r23492
    Fix a hang during character translation (r23492).
    Theoretically improve memory usage in an edge case (r23491).
    Justification:
      Hangs are bad - this example was reporting by a user.
    Note:
      r23492 depends upon -91, or something very like it, even though
      -91 is an unrelated change, strictly speaking.
    Votes:
      +1: malcolm, dlr

  * r23514, r23516, r23519
    Fix a bug in dumpstream loading where datestamp-less revisions do
    not remain so after load (issue #2729).
    Justification:
      Before-and-after repository data parity (yeah, it's a stretch...)
    Votes:
      +1: cmpilato (not r23519), dlr
