Candidate changes:

  * r16860
    Initial import of the Python version of svnmerge.py.

      It's written in Python!
      It's a contrib program!
      It's much better than the Bourne shell version!

  * r16350
    Fix issue #1911, where svndumpfilter generated invalid dumpfiles
    when copies occurred and --drop-empty-revs and --renumber-revs

    Justification:
      Invalid dumpfiles are not nice.

  * r16806, r16807, r16842

  * r16855
    Don't write empty hashes to props file.
    Justification:
      Severely bloats working copy size and causes extra i/o when you
      have a lot of files, but no properties on them.  (4k per file on
      most fs'en.)

Approved changes:

   * r16834
     Initialize SVN_ASP_DOT_NET_HACK in the Perl and Ruby bindings.
     Justification:
       Consistent with behavior of the command-line client and Python
       bindings in supporting this work-around.
