   * r16979
     Use apr_int64_t and apr_uint64_t in place of "long long" in Ruby typemaps.

   * r16980, r16982
     Fix broken "long long *OUTPUT" typemaps in Perl and Python bindings.

   * r16984, r16985
     Update APR typemaps to be more portable, so that they will work on

     Votes:
       +1: djames

   * r16966
     Use "const unsigned char", because SWIG cannot parse "unsigned const char".

       Unable to include svn_md5 functions in bindings.
     Votes:
       +1: clkao

   * r16975, r16989, r16990
     Actually fix the cause of perl bindings segfault by allocating for
     result_digest, and make it overloaded object that actually reads
     the digest when accessing.
     Depends: r16930, r16966
     Justification:
       Bindings segfaults.
     Notes:
       Actually reverts r16930.

       +1: clkao

Approved changes:

   * r16914, r16919
     Remove unused and unnecessary portability typemaps from the SWIG
     bindings. Followup to r16903.
     Justification:
       Unused, invalid, and unnecessary portability typemaps can mislead.
     Votes:
       +1: djames, jerenkrantz

   * r16930
     Tweak Perl bindings to avoid use of goto in svn_txdelta_apply.
     Justification:
       Prevents segfaults in the Perl test suite.
     Notes:
       The goto &function syntax can cause segfaults, if the supplied
       function is a SWIG/C wrapper.

   * r16972
     Fix autogen.sh-time SWIG Makefile to work with Solaris /bin/sh.
