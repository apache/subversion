This file tracks the status of releases in the 1.2.x line.

See "Stabilizing and maintaining releases" in trunk/HACKING for
details on how release lines and voting work, what kinds of bugs can
delay a release, etc.

Status of 1.2.2:
================

Candidate changes:

  * r15248
    Perl bindings: Make compatible with SWIG 1.3.25.
    Justification:
      Distributions will start to update to the new version, and will
      require support to continue building subversion-perl packages.
    Votes:
      +1: maxb, clkao

  * r15233
    Reduce memory consumption by the client when performing merge
    operations.
    Justification:
      Consuming 2GB of memory while performing a merge on a large
      working copy is bad.

  * r15251
    Prevent crash when more than 50 options passed to a command line program.
    Justification:
      Crashes bad!
    Votes:
      +1: maxb

  * r15290
    Hooks bugfix: if lock already exists and --force not passed, then
    don't call 'pre-(un)lock'.
    Justification:
      'pre'-hooks shouldn't be called when we *know* the filesystem is
      going to disallow the action.  This results in multiple hook
      calls for no good reason as the user re-attempts the action.

      +1: sussman, cmpilato

  * r15135
    Resolve location-tracing performance issue against 1.0.x servers.
    Justification:
      We can be pretty stupidly slow in many cases; can encourage
      people to stay at 1.0.x and 1.1.x clients instead of upgrading.

  * r14008, r14458, r14587, r14632
    Fixes to svnmerge.
    Justification:
      It would be good to have contrib code be the latest and fixed
      version.  We don't guarantee that this code works, but it would
      be good to have known fixes released.  This fixes four issues.
      Blair has used the code in trunk in a production environment and
      it works great.
