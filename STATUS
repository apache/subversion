Candidate changes:
==================

 * r1705038
   Fix issue #4607, patch with missing newline removes newline when applied.
   Justification:
     Silently makes unexpected changes.
   Votes:
     +1: philip
     +0: rhuijben (while I agree that this patch fixes a problem, I don't
                   think this is the right backport. This patch changes the
                   behavior of a public api (with no known users except
                   libsvn_client) in a specific way for this issue. On trunk
                   this behavior change was reverted when a better fix was
                   implemented)

 * r1800754,r1800755,r1800803,r1801705,r1801722,r1823202,r1823203
   Fix issue #4686 "Unable to parse reversed revision range '19634-19631'"
   Justification:
     Assertion failure during certain merges.

   Votes:
     +1: julianfoad, brane

 * r1826720, r1826721, r1827191, r1827574

     +1: stefan2 (without r1827574)

 * r1845212
   Silence a deprecation warning from amalgamated SQLite on macOS.
   Justification:
     Keeps the macOS warnings checker buildslave clean.
   Votes:
     +1: brane

 * r1696722
   Add a note to 'tools/client-side/detach.py' about how this doesn't work
   (at least not properly) with 1.8+ WCs.
   Justification:
     Try harder not to annoy the users who come across this script.
   Notes:
     Only needs one +1 and one +0 vote, at most.
     See https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/SVN-2884?focusedCommentId=14925199&page=com.atlassian.jira.plugin.system.issuetabpanels:comment-tabpanel#comment-14925199

     +1: julianfoad

Veto-blocked changes:
=====================

 * r1701488
   Issue #4592 "fix contrib check-mime-type.pl for changes to 'svnlook proplist'
     output", http://subversion.tigris.org/issues/show_bug.cgi?id=4592
   Justification:
     Make this contributed script work again, after 1.7.8 broke it.
   Notes:
     Brett Randall put effort into contributing this fix: see the dev@ email
     thread "[patch][reboot-topic] fix check-mime-type.pl for changes to
     'svnlook proplist' output" started by him on 2015-08-07, archived at
     e.g. <http://svn.haxx.se/dev/archive-2015-08/0047.shtml> or
     <http://mail-archives.apache.org/mod_mbox/subversion-dev/201508.mbox/%3CCALeEUB56NVCR0nCZ2rYki6oKQNcVPPLvWTeCoYyrMqitsov0ag@mail.gmail.com%3E>.
   Votes:
     +0: julianfoad, rhuijben (he says it works, but I haven't reviewed or tested)
     +0: danielsh (not tested; would be nice to have a $ anchor in the pattern)
     -1: brane (Not a valid backport, contrib/ is not in the release tarball.)
