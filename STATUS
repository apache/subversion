Status of 1.1.0:
================

  * r10616, r10638
    Work around directory creation bug in APR shipped with httpd 2.0.50.
    Justification:
      Not a tiny patch, but most of the pieces are simple and
      independent.  Bug breaks shared working copies and litters
      unsightly sticky bits around people's working copies and
      repositories.
