Candidate changes for 1.5.0:
============================

 * r31059, 31060, 31061, 31075, 31151
   Fix issue #3157, Merging a change from a path's natural history
   creates self-referential mergeinfo
   Notes:
     r31075 and 31151 are the core fixes for the issue, the other revisions
     are a new test for it (and a few minor follow-ups to that test).
     The addition of the new merge test in r31059 trivally conflicts
     because several other new merge tests are not backported yet.

 * r30629, r30787
    mod_dontdothat: Allow opt-out of replay rejection.
    Notes:
      r30787 is a typo fix.
    Votes:
      +1: jerenkrantz, cmpilato

 * r31243, r31246, r31249, r31250, r31251, r31271
   Fix issue #3200, API Ickiness:  svn_client_ctx_t shouldn't carry
   "extra revprops"; the svn_client APIs should
   Notes:
     If we *don't* backport this in 1.5.0, we need to undo the changes
     or otherwise rework them to use newly-revved svn_client APIs.
     This is not quite finished -- need feedback from Ruby, Perl, and
     JavaHL bindings maintainers.
   Votes:

 * r31273
   Let JavaHL return arbitrary revprops through the logMessages() method.
   Notes:
     Although not directly part of issue #3200, it is complimentary to it.
     The r31274 group depends on this change to test (and to merge cleanly).
   Votes:
     +1: hwright (pending merge of issue #3200 fixes)

 * r31274, r31275, r31276
   Extend issue #3200 API fixes to the JavaHL bindings.
   Notes:
     This depends on r31273 and the issue #3200 group.
     As it touches 1.5 APIs, This should be merged, or fixed up on trunk.
   Votes:
     +1: hwright (pending merge of issue #3200 fixes)

 * r31292
   JavaHL: add support for Windows SSL certs as was done for CLI.
   Notes:
     This was added to the CLI in r23812 but was never added in JavaHL.
   Votes:
     +1: markphip

 * r31303
   Skip a recently backported test when doing backwards-compatibility testing.
   Notes:
     Makes the backwards-compatibility test suite pass again.

Candidate changes for 1.5.1:
============================

 * r31196, r31199, r31280, r31283, r31287
   Don't commit an add of a missing item (issue #3198).
   Notes:
     r31199 is a trivial followup that adds a missing SVN_ERR() wrap.
     r31280, r31283 and r31287 add a regression test.
   Votes:
     +1: kfogel (r31196 and r31199 only)
     +0: danielsh
     +1: lgo

 * r31228
   Fix issue #2721: don't croak on invalid dates in 'log' and 'blame'.
   Justification:
     Let the commands be useful even when some revisions' dates are corrupt.
