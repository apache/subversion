This file tracks the status of releases in the 1.6.x line.

See "Stabilizing and maintaining releases" in trunk/www/hacking.html for
details on how release lines and voting work, what kinds of bugs can
delay a release, etc.

Status of 1.6.17:

Candidate changes:
==================

 * r966167
   Allow passing --with-jdk to gen-make.py
   Backport branch in:
     ^/subversion/branches/1.6.x-r966167
   Justification:
     On 64 bit windows, looking in the registry will not always return the
     right jdk to compile Subversion with. This patch allows specifying
     a specific jdk.
     (Which then fixes building 1.6.x on the Windows buildbots)
   Votes:
     +1: rhuijben     

 * r1390653
   Add Vary: header to GET response.
   Justification:
     The 1.8 serf-only client may fail to work with caching proxies.

Veto-blocked changes:
=====================

 * r877552, r877617, r877618, r877619, r877621
   Support using `svnversion` on files and improve some messages printed by
   `svnversion`.
   Justification:
     Some messages printed by `svnversion` are inconsistent and sometimes
     incorrect:
     $ svnversion /usr
     exported
     $ svnversion /bin/ls
     '/bin/ls' not versioned, and not exported
     $ svnversion VERSIONED_FILE
     'VERSIONED_FILE' not versioned, and not exported
     $ svnversion /nonexistent
     subversion/libsvn_wc/questions.c:90: (apr_err=2)
     svn: '/nonexistent' does not exist
     ^^^
     Messages with these revisions backported:
     $ svnversion /usr
     Unversioned directory
     $ svnversion /bin/ls
     Unversioned file
     $ svnversion VERSIONED_FILE
     NUMBER
     $ svnversion /nonexistent
     '/nonexistent' doesn't exist
   Votes:
     +1: arfrever
     -0: cmpilato (Introduces new features and changes output)
     -1: rhuijben (Introduces new features and changes output;
                   I think it should be removed from STATUS)

 * r878078, r878088, r878102, r878196
   Make KWallet window attached to terminal window.
   Justification:
     Without this change, KWallet window can appear behind terminal window
     and is left after killing terminal.
   Votes:
     +1: arfrever
     -0: peters
     -1: rhuijben ("/proc/%ld/stat" is ugly and Linux-specific -
                   would just getenv("WINDOWID") work instead?)
     -1: stsp (I've removed the Linux-specific code from trunk in r1002144
               and r1002151, so trunk code only relies on getenv("WINDOWID").
               I would +1 a backport that also merges these revisions).

 * r916286, r917512
   Fixes failing commmits (with vague error messages) seen on client
   side for WebDAV proxy configurations such as the following (note
   the trailing slash at the end of '/svn/'):
   
      <Location /svn/>
         DAV svn
         SVNParentPath /repositories
         # Trailing slash on the master URI also can cause the confusion.
         SVNMasterURI http://master/svn/
         SVNAdvertiseV2Protocol Off
      </Location>
   
   Error message shows up like so:
   
      svn: Commit failed (details follow):
      svn: MKACTIVITY of '/svn/demujin/!svn/act/4b6d547c-018d-4e02-9d3f-2b28\
      3076cc06': Could not read status line: connection was closed by server\
       (http://localhost)
   
   Notes:
     Depends on the r878590 group for a conflict-free backport.
   Justification:
     Fixes failed commits.
   Votes:
     +1: kameshj
     -1: pburba (the net change of r916286 and r917512 relies on the 1.7 API
         svn_uri_canonicalize.  This API does exist in 1.6, but only for
         testing purposes, see subversion\libsvn_subr\private_uri.h and
         http://svn.apache.org/viewvc?view=revision&revision=876419
         So problem #1: This won't build.
         
         Problem #2: Since I first made this veto, further changes were
         backported which prevent a clean merge.)

 * r933194
   Fix for issue #2753
   SVNListParentPath feature doesn't work when svn authz is used.
   Justification:
     This issue is waiting for resolution for more than 3 years.
   Notes:
     See discussion at http://svn.haxx.se/dev/archive-2010-04/0275.shtml
   Votes:
     -1: cmpilato (pending results of aforemented discussion)

 * r950445, 950468
   Fix for issue #2591 "'svnadmin hotcopy' does not replicate symlinks".
   Justification:
     This fix helps server administrators who has common files symlinked
     across their repositories and take frequent backups of their repos
     using svnadmin hotcopy.
   Notes:
     r950445 fixes the issue and r950468 is a test for this issue.
     In r967173 on trunk, svn_io_dir_walk()'s original functionality
     was restored, and svn_io_dir_walk2() introduced to also cover
     symlinks.
   Votes:
     +1: stylesen,
     -0: julianfoad (Tested and works fine, but changes semantics of
           svn_io_dir_walk() which we should not do in a back-port.
           Discussing on list.)
     -1: cmpilato (Changes semantics of svn_io_dir_walk()).

 * r996383
   Add shorthands for 'svn --accept=%s' values.
   Justication:
     Require less typing to resolve conflicts.
   Votes:
     +1: danielsh, blair
     -0: rhuijben (Should we apply a change like this in a patch release?)
     -0: stsp (I'd say no...)
     -0: pburba (I see no harm, but have to agree with stsp)
     -1: cmpilato (to the degree that our command-line syntax is an API,
         this would prevent rollback to prior 1.6.x versions without
         changes to scripts which call this API)

 * r879766
   Fix issue #3498: Subversion password stores freeze Eclipse
   Justification:
     All subclipse users are in great need of this.
   Branch:
     Resolves a minor conflict in libsvn_auth_gnome_keyring/gnome_keyring.c
     where the code changed was refactored on trunk.
     ^/subversion/branches/1.6.x-r39692
   Votes:
     +1: stylesen
     +0: julianfoad (reviewed, not tested)
     -0: rhuijben (needs more explanation: The not-interactive and no
                   callback code paths should be more similar if the code
                   works correctly. I think the not interactive code path
                   needs the same fix).
     -1: markphip (tested multiple builds of this and never saw it work).

Approved changes:
