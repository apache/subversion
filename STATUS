Candidate changes for 1.5.2:
============================

 * r32409
   Fix an incompatibility with BSD make, which was introduced in r24293.
   Justification:
     Trivial fix. Fixes out-of-tree build of the bindings on BSD.
     Might help downstream packagers for these systems.
   Votes:
     +1: stsp, arfrever
     +0: cmpilato

 * r32416, r32421
   Respect LDFLAGS in Perl bindings.
   Notes:
     Previously LDFLAGS were ignored (except for libsvn_swig_perl) even when
     the SWIG_LDFLAGS variable was set.
   Votes:
     +1: arfrever

 * r32417, r32538
   Fix issue #3255: client capabilities were not passed to start-commit
   Justification:
     Without this fix, start-commit cannot do early rejection of
     commits from clients that do not support mergeinfo.
     r32538 removes duplicated headers from the neon capablity exchange request.
   Votes:
     +1: kfogel (r32417 only)
     +1: rhuijben, cmpilato

 * r32441
   Fix issue #3258: 8lock.t fails in non-English locale.
   Votes:
     +1: arfrever
     +0: hwright

 * r32442
   Respect LDFLAGS in SWIG bindings without the requirement of the exporting
   of the SWIG_LDFLAGS variable.
   Votes:
     +1: arfrever

 * r32444, r32445
   Fix issue #3237, relative externals may core dump.
   Votes:
     +1: blair, hwright

 * r32467, r32470
   Fix working copy corruption which happens when copying a file
   into a directory that exists in the entries file of its parent,
   but is not physically present on disk.
   Justification:
     If this happens, 'svn cleanup' won't help. There is no way to make
     the working copy usable again except manually editing the log.
   Branch:
     ^/branches/1.5.x-r32470
   Votes:
     +1: stsp, danielsh

 * r31725, r31837
   Canonicalise URIs which have an empty hostname part correctly.
   This fixes the crash described in #2116 ('svn log file:///'
   results in a failed assertion).
   Justification:
     Been fixed in trunk for a while, rediscovered in 1.5.1 by
     Toby Peterson <toby@apple.com>, see this thread:
     http://subversion.tigris.org/servlets/ReadMsg?list=dev&msgNo=141888
   Notes:
     r31837 fixes a bug introduced in r31725:
     Take an early out if path is "", to avoid accessing uninitialized
     memory later when we look at *(dst - 1).
   Votes:
     +1: stsp, danielsh

 * r32497, r32510
   Make libsvn_ra_neon initialization thread-safe: fix a race condition where
   if two neon requests are started at approximately at the same time, one
   call starts initializing and the other call thinks initialization is
   already completed. (r32510 is a minor code simplification)
   Justification:
     Fixes a reproducable crash when performing dav requests via multiple
     threads at the same time (reported as issue on the SharpSvn users list).
   Votes:
     +1: rhuijben

 * r32494, r32522, r32523
   Fix a bug where previous merges are incorrectly reversed leading to repeat
   merges and spurious conflicts.
   Notes:
     r32494 is just a doc string tweak that hopefully makes the real fix a
     easier to review, r32522 is a test for the bug, and r32523 is the real
     fix.  There is a trivial conflict on r32494 when adding the new merge
     test due to the fact that some other new merge tests are not backported
     yet.
   Justification:
     Repeat merges and needless conflicts in the age of merge tracking are,
     to put it mildly, less than desirable, see
     http://subversion.tigris.org/servlets/ReadMsg?list=dev&msgNo=141832.

 * r32545
   Fix some pool usage problems in the FS backend node-origin
   calculation logic.
   Justification:
     Pool lifetime issues are bad.  Real bad.
   Votes:
     +1: cmpilato, gstein
