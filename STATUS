Status of 1.2.4:
================

Candidate changes:

  * r14646
    Allow users to "make clean" without running Makefile.PL.
    Justification:
      Trivial fix.
    Votes:
      +1: djames

  * r15906, r15941
    Favour "python" over "python2", if "python" is Python 2.x.
    Branch: 1.2.x-r15906-r15941
    Justification:
      Allows Python bindings to build correctly when the user upgrades
      the standard "python" binary to Python 2.4, but leaves the
      nonstandard "python2" binary as Python 2.2.
    Notes:
      In the 1.2.x-r15906-r15941 branch, I merged r15906 and r15941
      from trunk. I did not include the changes in r15906 which affect
      autogen.sh, because the changes to autogen.sh can wait until
      Subversion 1.3.

  * r15943, r15967, r16050
    Improve portability of the build system for Python bindings, so that
    they will work out of the box in a variety of build setups.
    Branch: 1.2.x-r15943-r15967-r16050
    Justification:
      Improves portability.
    Notes:
      Branch solves a trivial merge conflict.
    Votes:
      +1: djames

  * /branches/1.2.x-issue-2388
    mod_authz_svn bugfix: commiting empty revisions incorrectly
    authorized.
    Justification:
      Unauthorized users can pollute revision space with empty
      revisions or dangling transactions.
    Notes:
      See the original bug report at
      http://subversion.tigris.org/issues/show_bug.cgi?id=2388

  * r16829
    Fix svn_wc_dup_status2() to deep copy the "url" field.
    Justification:
      Refering to memory allocated in an old pool is bad, could cause
      crashes.
    Notes:
      We only want part of r16829, as it includes copying of some
      additional fields which do not exist in 1.2.x (the merge is
      trivial).
    Votes:
      +1: dlr, rooneg

  * r18127 (only build/win32/svn.rc)
    Fix copyright dates shown in Subversion Windows binaries.
    Justification:
      Up to and including 1.3.0, those dates were still 2000-2004...
    Votes:
      +1 brane

 * r19915
   Require APR 0.9.7
   Justification:
     Older APR versions didn't return errors upon failed writes
     with buffered files: Potential repository corruption with FSFS.
   Votes:
     +1: dionisos

Approved changes (further review is welcome, but not required):

  * r15807
    Guard against NULL stream write calls.
    Branch: 1.2.x-r15807
    Justification:
      Affects Python bindings only. Prevents crashes when using
      ViewCVS with remote repositories.
