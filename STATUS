 * r1881985, r1882105

 * r1882326
   Fix issue #4762 "authz doesn't combine global and repository rules"
   Justification:
     Restore behaviour of SVN 1.9: It is now again possible to override
     per-path access rules for specific users (and groups) at the global
     level. Such global rules are overridden by repository-specific rules
     only if both the user and the path match the repository-specific rule.
   Votes:
     +1: stsp, brane

 * r1875675
   Rewrite load_normalize_node_props to avoid literal trailing spaces.

 * r1877310
   Add a test for issue #4711 "invalid xml file produced by svn log --xml

=====================

 * r1881534, r1883388
