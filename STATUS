details on how release lines and voting work, what kinds of bugs can
delay a release, etc.

Status of 1.4.7:
================

Candidate changes:

  * r21989, r22884, r23347-23349, r23357, r23359, r23363, r23364, r23384,
    r23385, r23387, r23395, r23763, r23764, r23794, r23795, r23799, r23807
    Bring mucc and mucc-test.py up to date with respect to trunk,
    except for r23427, which uses svn_stringbuf_from_file2() in 1.5.
    Justification:
      This is becoming a very useful tool for making restructuring
      commits that would otherwise require extremely large working
      copies.
    Notes:
      Blair ran mucc-test.py against this merge and it passed the
      test.  The person doing the merge should ensure that mucc-test.sh is
      deleted, as svnmerge.py skips that for some reason.  Also, if
      a test merge run is done with without committing and then
      reverting, then also delete the new mucc-test.py, since the
      next svnmerge.py will ignore it the second time around.
    Votes:
      +1: blair, cmpilato
      -0: glasser (while backporting mucc is a reasonable idea, it has changed 
           a lot since this was proposed, including changing its name; either
           don't backport at all or backport even more)

  * r25178, -461
    Fix issue 2712: If 'anon-access' is 'read' but anonymous access is
    disallowed via authz rules, updates/checkouts won't work, even for users
    with appropriate permissions.
    Justification:
      User reported problem, small fix, includes test.
    Branch: 1.4.x-r25178
    Votes:
      +1: vgeorgescu, sussman
      -0: glasser (the ra_svn protocol, even on trunk, is severely broken
           if you have anon-access=read and any read-authz-blocked paths;
           these revs only fix one of a large number of symptoms of this
           issue.  a better fix might be a way to tell your client not to
           log in ANONYMOUS even if it's an option)

 * r30004
   Fix the client-side problem described in issue #2382
   As this fix causes a conflict, it sits on a temporary branch:
   https://svn.collab.net/repos/svn/branches/1.4.x-r30004/
   Justification: Without this fix, clients cannot connect reliably
     to svnserve daemons running on IPv4/IPv6 dual-stack hosts,
     or IPv4-only hosts with multiple A records. See the issue for details.
   Notes: #2382 is a long-standing issue. It was rediscovered
      by Stefan Küng in http://svn.haxx.se/dev/archive-2008-03/0585.shtml

Veto-blocked changes:

  * r21531, r21848, r21934
    Allow HTTP auth protocols to be configurable by way of a
    "http-auth-types" parameter.
    Justification:
      Allow GSSAPI/SSPI auth to be enabled/disabled on Windows with
      Neon 0.26.1+, addressesing numerous bug reports from
      TortoiseSVN, Subversion, Subclipse, etc.
