This file tracks the status of releases in the 1.0.x line.

See "Stabilizing and maintaining releases" in trunk/HACKING for
details on how release lines and voting work, what kinds of bugs can
delay a release, etc.

Status of 1.0.0:
================

Release 1.0.0 is already frozen.  The candidate tarball was
subversion-0.37.0.tar.gz for a four week soak period; we'll put out
1.0.0-beta1 on Friday, February 20th as a final sanity check, then
release 1.0.0 on February 23rd, 2004.  If you find a bug that you
think is important enough to delay 1.0.0, please start a dev@ list
thread and mention the thread below.
