This file tracks the status of releases in the 1.1.x line.

See "Stabilizing and maintaining releases" in trunk/HACKING for
details on how release lines and voting work, what kinds of bugs can
delay a release, etc.

Status of 1.1.4:
================

Showstoppers:

  * r12718
    SWIG 1.3.24+ changes were not properly backported.  Makefile.in changes
    were omitted.  LSWIGPY and LSWIGPL need to be merged so that <1.3.24 can
    work correctly.

Candidate changes that seem to have become stalled
due to persistent lack of votes:

  * r12075, r12448
    Add pre-0.14 dumpfile compatability.
    Justification: Some very old clients were recently spotted in
    the wild.  And: Dumpfile compatibility is always good.
    Notes: These look good to me, but are complex enough that I'm not
      comfortable +1'ing without testing on an old dumpfile, and I
      haven't done that yet.  -kfogel

      -0: ringstrom (because the patch is non-trivial and there is only a
                     single known pre-0.14 user)
      -0: ghudson (not really comfortable having this code in the trunk,
                   much less 1.1; dumpfile compatibility in general
                   good, pre-0.14 compatibility not so important)
      +0: kfogel

  * r11050
    Add install dependencies for libsvn_fs and libsvn_fs_base.
    Justification:
      Allows users to install JavaHL separately, without needing to
      compile and install the base subversion package.  Without this
      fix, JavaHL installation crashes in that case.

Candidate changes:

  * r12636
    Dataloss bug in svndumpfilter - delete-all-properties-from-node operations
    are lost.
    Justification:
      Dataloss!
    Branch:
      1.1.x-svndumpfilter r12656:12657
      Does not itself conflict, but present on branch so that does not
      cause conflicts in the merge of later revisions.
    Votes:
      +1: maxb, dionisos

  * r13222, r13223, r13232
    Rewrite libsvn_fs_fs's auto-merge algorithm
    Justification:
      unacceptable performance (>50 minutes for a small commit) in
      a repository with 300,000 revisions
    Branch:
      1.1.x-r13222@13517
    Votes:
      +1: epg, ghudson

  * r13553
    Fix issue #2173 (Symbolic links from Linux are not ignored in Windows)
    Justification:
      High embarassment factor, a highly touted 1.1 feature that no worky.
    Votes:
      +1: cmpilato, jpieper

  * r13683
    Fix FSFS segfault when handling non-existent data representations
    Justification:
      Client will segfault on otherwise valid revision files.
    Votes:
      +1: jpieper

Approved changes (further review is welcome, but not required):

  * r12637, r12640
    Very bad memory handling in svndumpfilter - caches an entire revision
    of data in memory.
    Justification:
      Makes the use of svndumpfilter on dumpstreams containing files
      larger than available RAM, or revisions in which the total size of
      changed files is larger than available RAM, totally impossible.
      This is a showstopper bug, since we do not have obliterate.
    Notes:
      r12637 is purely re-ordering of entire functions with no effective
      code changes whatsoever, in order to make the diff of r12640 more
      easily reviewable.
    Branch:
      1.1.x-svndumpfilter r12657:12659
      (Each merged revision committed to branch seperately)
      NEEDS AS YET UNAPPROVED r12636 TO APPLY CLEANLY
    Votes:
      +1: maxb, sussman, dionisos

  * r12499, r12542, plus branch-only modification in r12670
    Make mailer.py work on Windows.
    Justification:
      Our flagship mailing hook-script should work on all platforms.
    Notes:
      The branch-only modification was inlining a piece of code available
      in the 1.2 and later Python bindings into mailer.py so that it can
      function with 1.1 bindings.
    Branch:
      1.1.x-mailer.py r12543:HEAD
    Votes:
      +1: maxb
      +0: cmpilato (only tested that it didn't regress on Unix)

  * r13504
    Fix bindings build with SWIG 1.3.25-dev.
    Justification:
      Tiny change, avoids our dependencies being stricter than they need to be.
    Votes:
      +1: maxb, cmpilato
