Status of 1.8.20:

Candidate changes:
==================

 * r1803435
   'svnadmin load' fails with bogus SHA1 collision error.
   Justification:
     This is a user-reported issue and will prevent users from loading
     certain dump files.  It might also result in silent data corruption
     due to inconsistent cache contents (no reproduction available ATM).
     The fix itself is low-risk as it conditionally disables caches.
   Branch:
     ^/subversion/branches/1.8.x-fsfs-txn-access

Veto-blocked changes:
=====================

 * r1701488
   Issue #4592 "fix contrib check-mime-type.pl for changes to 'svnlook proplist'
     output", http://subversion.tigris.org/issues/show_bug.cgi?id=4592
   Justification:
     Make this contributed script work again, after 1.7.8 broke it.
   Notes:
     Brett Randall put effort into contributing this fix: see the dev@ email
     thread "[patch][reboot-topic] fix check-mime-type.pl for changes to
     'svnlook proplist' output" started by him on 2015-08-07, archived at
