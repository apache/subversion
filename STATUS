Candidate changes for 1.5.5:
============================

 * r30257, r33024, r33026
   Don't try to filter natural history from added mergeinfo during
   reverse merges.
   Notes:
     r30257 is the urelated removal of an unused private struct in merge.c,
     not required but avoids a conflict with r33024.  r33024 is a change to
     include more information in the merge command baton, it results in no
     functional change itself but r33026 relies on this new information.
     There's a single trailing whitespace conflict during merge of r33024.
     r33026 is the core change.
   Justification:
     A reverse merge should simply return mergeinfo to a previous
     representation -- see
     http://subversion.tigris.org/servlets/ReadMsg?listName=dev&msgNo=142777.
     This change also improves reverse merge performance as it eliminates
     some unnecessary communication with the repository.

 * r33866
   Make ra_svn's Cyrus auth implementation (like the internal auth
   implementation) always prefer EXTERNAL to ANONYMOUS.  This prevents
   a weird regression vs 1.4 where svn+ssh:// would be treated as
   anonymous in some cases.
   Justification:
     Regression against 1.4 which can prevent users from even checking
     out repositories that they could check out with a 1.4 client.

 * r34082, r34096
   Fix issue #3275 by making WebDAV proxy slave servers pass through
   any GET or PROPFIND requests aimed at working resource URLs, even
   though those requests are read-only.  Why?  It does no good for the
   slave server to try to answer a read request aimed at an
   uncommitted transaction when said transaction's data lives solely
   on the master server.

 * r34385, r34393
   Fix broken merge when the merge target's natural history includes
   resurrections.
   Notes:
     r34385 is a new test.  r34393 is the fix.
   Justification:
     This problem was encountered 'in the wild' - see
     http://svn.haxx.se/dev/archive-2008-11/0618.shtml.  When encountered
     cherry harvest merges are completely broken.

 * r34423
   Fix issue #3312 "Mergeinfo for '...' maps to an empty revision range"
   due to sparse merging.
   Justification:
     Some people do merge into sparse directories or targets with switched
     subtrees; this produces non-inheritable mergeinfo.  This non-inheritable
     mergeinfo can cause an error during merging or log -g.  See issue #3312
     and http://svn.haxx.se/dev/archive-2008-10/1170.shtml.

 * r34432
   Follow-up to r32975, which is already backported and had a bug, see
   http://subversion.tigris.org/servlets/ReadMsg?listName=dev&msgNo=145757.
   Notes:
     There is a very minor whitespace conflict in merge_props_changed().
   Justification:
     r32975 fixed a bug which occurred when a merge added explicit mergeinfo
     to a subtree that had no explicit mergeinfo prior to the merge.  But
     this fix itself had a bug which could result in an error during a
     --dry-run merge, r34432 fixes this.

 * r34091, r34094, r34244, r34256, r34306
    Various svn merge --reintegrate improvements.
   Notes:
     There is a backport branch for these changes at
     http://svn.collab.net/repos/svn/branches/1.5.x-reintegrate-improvements.
   Justification:
     Prior to these changes reintegrate would not work if the merge source
     had any subtree mergeinfo.  Since subtree mergeinfo is quite common,
     this meant reintegrate was largely unuseable.  With these changes
     reintegrate will work as long as the source's subtree mergeinfo and
     implicit mergeinfo reflect the fact that the reintegrate target was
     previously merged uniformly to the source for some contiguous revision
     range starting at the revision the source was branched from the target.
     These changes also improve the notoriously vague error message which
     occurred when reintegrate was thwarted by subtree mergeinfo.
