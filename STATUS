Status of 1.7.0:

Candidate changes:
==================

 * r1146131 and followups
   Add svn_fs_verify() and implement rep-cache verification in FSFS using it.
   Branch:
     1.7.x-fs-verify
   Justification:
     Would be nice to extend verify already in 1.7.x.
   Notes:
     This does not include progress reporting, since that is nominated
     separately.
   Votes:
     +0: danielsh
     +0: gstein (progress would be nice)

 * fs-progress branch
   Notes:
     Depends on the r1146131 group (1.7.x-fs-verify).
   Branch:
     fs-progress
   Justification:
     Provide feedback during 'svnadmin verify'.
     Avoid an API change in 1.8.
   Notes:
     If this proposal passes, the docstrings @since would have to be fixed
     in a new commit.
   Votes:
     +0: danielsh

 * r1147293, r1147309
   Fix issue #3960 'URL-to-WC copy with --quiet segfaults'.
   Justification:
     Fixes a segfault.
   Notes: r1147293 fixes the segfault.  r1147309 fixes a similar
   bug for WC-to-URL copies, albeit one which doesn't result in a
   segfault.

Approved changes:
=================

 * r1146684
   Report the right wcroot in an 'svn upgrade' error message.
   Justification:
     Telling users they should upgrade the wrong directory is not
     what I call user friendly.
   Votes:
     +1: rhuijben, philip, gstein

 * r1146832, r1146834
   Resolve several whitespace issues and a warning that is always visible
   for git-svn users.
   Justification:
     Trivial fix which suppresses warning.
   Notes:
     Binding change rules apply
   Votes:
     +1: peters
     +0: rhuijben (I think it should be backported, but I can't test this)
     +0: gstein (likewise)

 * r1146899
   Improve configure detection of Ruby.
   Justification:
     Saner configure output, and don't override user's choice of a ruby when
     multiple are available.
   Votes:
     +1: arfrever, danielsh, julianfoad

 * r1146904
   Fix the 'extraclean' target of the Makefile to remove config.{guess,sub}
   Justification:
     1.6 removes these.
   Votes:
     +1: arfrever, philip, julianfoad

 * r1146781
   Fix a bug in subtree merging.  See email thread by Barry Scott, 2011-07-02,
   "Assert in svn-1.7-alpha2 svn_client_merge3",
   <http://svn.haxx.se/dev/archive-2011-07/0052.shtml>.
   Justification:
   Notes:
     Not applicable to 1.6.x.
   Votes:
     +1: julianfoad, rhuijben, philip
