<h2>Merge Tracking Functional Specification</h2>

<p><a href="index.html">Merge tracking</a> functional
specification.</p>

<p style="color: red">TODO:
Incorporate <a

findings</a>.  Describe how
each <a href="requirements.html">requirement</a> will actually
function for Subversion.  Remove redundancies.</p>

<h3>Repeated Merge</h3>

<p>There are two general schemes for solving the <a
href="requirements.html#repeated-merge">repeated merge</a>
problem.</p>

<div id="aslb-merge">
<h4>Ancestry-Sensitive Line-Based Merge</h4>

<p>Make 'hunks' of contextually-merged text sensitive to ancestry.</p>

<p>A high-resolution version of <a
href="requirements.html#repeated-merge">repeated merge</a>.  Rather
than tracking whole changesets, we track the lineage of specific lines
of code within a file.  The basic idea is that when re-merging a
particular hunk of code, the contextual-merging process is aware that
certain lines of code already represent the merging of particular
lines of development.  Jack Repenning has a great example of this from
ClearCase (see ASCII diagram below).</p>

<p>See the <a href="../variance-adjusted-patching.html">variance
adjusted patching</a> document for an extended discussion of how to
implement this by composing diffs; see <a
href="http://svn.collab.net/svn-doxygen/svn__diff_8h.html#a11"
><code>svn_diff_diff4()</code></a> for an implementation of same.  We
may be closer to ancestry-sensitive merging than we think.</p>

<p>Here's an example demonstrating how individual lines of code can be
tracked.  In this diagram, we're drawing the lineage of a single file,
with time flowing downwards.  The file begins life with three lines of
text, "1\n2\n\3\n".  The file then splits into two lines of
development.</p>

                  \       |

                    \     |
                     \    |
                      \   |
                       \  |
                         one                ## This node is a human's
                         Two-point-five     ## merge of the changes
                         newline            ## since the last merge.
                         three
</pre>

<p>It's the second merge that's important here.</p>

<p>In a system like Subversion, the second merge of the left branch to
the right will fail miserably: the whole file's contents will be
placed within conflict markers.  That's because it's trying to dumbly
apply a patch that changes "1\n2\n3" to "one\nTwo\nthree", and the
target file has no matching lines at all.</p>

<p>A smarter system (like Clearcase) would remember that the previous
merge had happened, and specifically notice that the lines "one" and
"three" are the results of that previous merge.  Therefore, it would
ask the human only to deal with the "Two" versus "two-point-five"
conflict; the earlier changes ("1\n2\n3" to "one\ntwo\nthree") would
already be accounted for.</p>
