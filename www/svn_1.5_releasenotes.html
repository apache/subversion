<p>Details are described below.</p>

<p>Subversion 1.5 is a superset of all previous Subversion releases,
and is considered the current "best" release.  Anything in 1.0.x
through 1.4.x is also in 1.5, but 1.5 contains features and bugfixes
not present in any earlier release.  The new features will eventually
be documented in a 1.5 version of the free Subversion book, see <a
href="http://svnbook.red-bean.com">svnbook.red-bean.com</a>.</p>

</div>  <!-- news -->

<div class="h2" id="compatibility" title="compatibility">
<h2>Compatibility Concerns</h2>

<p>Older clients and servers interoperate transparently with 1.5
servers and clients.  Of course, some of the new 1.5 features may not
be available unless both client and server are the latest version
(e.g. <a href="/merge-tracking/func-spec.html#migration-and-interoperability"
>Merge Tracking</a>).  There is <strong>no need</strong> to dump and
reload your repositories; Subversion 1.5 can read repositories created
by earlier versions.  To upgrade an existing installation, just
install the newest libraries and binaries on top of the older
ones.</p>

<p>Subversion 1.5 maintains API/ABI compatibility with earlier
releases, by only adding new functions.  A program written to the 1.0,
1.1, 1.2 or 1.3 API can both compile and run using 1.5 libraries.
However, a program written for 1.5 cannot necessarily compile or run
against older libraries.</p>

<div class="h3" id="repos-format-change" title="repos-format-change">
<h3>Repository Format Changes</h3>

<p>Due to certain improvements and bugfixes made to the FS library,
the version number of the repository format has been incremented. This
means that pre-1.5 Subversion tools that normally access a repository
directly (e.g. <tt>svnserve</tt>, <tt>mod_dav_svn</tt>,
<tt>svnadmin</tt>) will <em>not</em> be able to read a repository
originally created by Subversion 1.5.</p>

</div>  <!-- repos-format-change -->

<div class="h3" id="output-changes" title="output-changes">
<h3>Command Line Output Changes</h3>

<p>Although the Subversion developers try hard to keep output from the
command line programs compatible between releases, new information
sometimes has to be added.  This might break scripts that rely on the
exact format of the output.  In 1.5, the following changes have been
made to the output:</p>

<p>XXX: Enumerate changes to output (e.g. for changelists).</p>

<ul>
  <li><p>Conflict markers in files now match the file's defined
    eol-style.</p></li>

<div class="h3" id="conflict-resolution" title="conflict-resolution">
<h3>Interactive Conflict Resolution (<em>client</em>)</h3>

<p>Added support for interactive conflict resolution in the command
line client, and a corresponding callback function in the client
library.  GUI clients can use the callback function to hook in a
graphical conflict resolution program to the
<code>update</code>/<code>switch</code>/<code>merge</code> commands.
Example command line output:</p>
<pre>
    svn up
    U    contrib/client-side/svnmerge/svnmerge_test.py
    Conflict discovered in 'contrib/client-side/svnmerge/svnmerge.py'.
    Select: (p)ostpone, (d)iff, (e)dit, (h)elp : h
      (p)ostpone - mark the conflict to be resolved later
      (d)iff     - show all changes made to merged file
      (e)dit     - change merged file in an editor
      (r)esolved - accept merged version of file
      (m)ine     - accept my version of file
      (t)heirs   - accept repository's version of file
      (l)aunch   - use third-party tool to resolve conflict
      (h)elp     - show this list

    Select: (p)ostpone, (d)iff, (e)dit, (h)elp : t
    G    contrib/client-side/svnmerge/svnmerge.py
    Updated to revision 25685.
</pre>
<p>This feature can be selectively disabled by using the --non-interactive
option, or disabled permanently by setting '[miscellany] interactive-conflicts
 = no' in your run-time config file.</p>

<p>The API for interactive conflict resolution is exposed via a
callback function and the following new data types:</p>

<ul>
  <li><code>svn_wc_conflict_resolver_func_t</code>, the callback API
    itself</li>
  <li><code>svn_wc_conflict_description_t</code>, a description of the
    conflict passed to the callback</li>
  <li><code>svn_wc_conflict_action_t</code>, the part of the conflict
    description indicating what the merge was trying to do</li>
  <li><code>svn_wc_conflict_reason_t</code>, the part of the conflict
    description indicating the type of conflict</li>
  <li><code>svn_wc_conflict_result_t</code>, returned by the callback
    as the result of any conflict resolution attempt</li>
</ul>

<p>Clients provide their callback function to Subversion's libraries
by setting it on the (new) <code>conflict_func</code> field of their
<code>svn_client_ctx_t</code>, and may provide additional state to the
callback via the corresponding <code>conflict_baton</code> field.</p>

<h3>Easier to try out experimental <tt>ra_serf</tt> DAV access module
(<em>client</em>)</h3>

<p>Subversion 1.4 introduced the experimental <tt>ra_serf</tt>
repository access module for accessing HTTP[S] DAV Subversion servers.
This uses the <a href="http://code.google.com/p/serf/">serf</a>
library instead of the Neon library which the original DAV support
uses.  serf supports pipelined requests which may lead to better
performance.  However, Subversion 1.4 required you to choose which
module to use for accessing DAV servers at build time, which made it
difficult to find out which module performs better for your usage
patterns.</p>

<p>Subversion 1.5 allows you to build both modules at the same time;
you can choose which library to use on a global or host-by-host basis
by setting the <tt>http-library</tt> variable in your run-time server
configuration file (<tt>~/.subversion/servers</tt>).  In recognition
of the fact that both libraries are DAV clients, we have
renamed <tt>ra_dav</tt> to <tt>ra_neon</tt>.</p>

<p>The Subversion 1.3.x line is no longer supported.  This doesn't
mean that your 1.3 installation is doomed; if it works well and is all
you need, that's fine.  "No longer supported" just means we've stopped
accepting bug reports against 1.3.x versions, and will not make any
more 1.3.x bugfix releases, except perhaps for absolutely critical
security or data-loss bugs.</p>
