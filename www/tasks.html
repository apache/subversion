<h1 style="text-align: center;">What Needs Doing?</h1>

<p>There are a lot of different things you can do to help Subversion.
Not all involve coding; there are plenty of non-programming roles for
eager volunteers.</p>

<p>Below are some of the needs we've identified, but please don't take
these as gospel!  New volunteers bring fresh viewpoints, and one of
the most important things you can do is point out a need we hadn't
recognized before&nbsp;&mdash;&nbsp;and then fill it.</p>

<div class="h2" id="summer-of-code" title="summer-of-code">
<h2>Google Summer of Code Tasks</h2>

<p>These are the ideas that the Subversion developers have for <a
href="http://code.google.com/soc/">Google Summer of Code</a>
applicants.  These are just some ideas&nbsp;&mdash;&nbsp;if you have
other ideas, we're happy to consider them too, please just post them
to <a
href="mailto:dev@subversion.tigris.org">dev@subversion.tigris.org</a>.</p>

<p>However, please don't select tasks in the other sections of this
page as your Summer of Code proposal, as those are either not the
right size for the Summer of Code, or are not coding tasks and
therefore not eligible.</p>

<p>You should also read the <a href="hacking.html">Hacker's Guide to
Subversion</a> before starting out on a proposal. Don't hesitate to
ask for details or start discussing one of these tasks on the <a
href="mailto:dev@subversion.tigris.org">dev@subversion.tigris.org</a>
mailing list (see <a
href="http://subversion.tigris.org/servlets/ProjectMailingListList"
>here</a> for subscription information).</p>

<p>In fact, please discuss your task on the mailing list regardless of
whether you've submitted your application yet.  Eagerness to engage
with the rest of the Subversion development community will be
considered favourable in evaluating your application.</p>

<p>If you have questions about the application process, compensation,
or the Google Summer of Code program in general, please see the
program <a

<h3>Allow Commit from multiple working copies</h3>

<p>Currently, 'svn commit' cannot commit changes that are located in
two or more disconnected working copies (lacking a common parent),
even if those working copies belong to the same repository.  This is
a fairly common need for users that work on multiple projects that
are all stored in the same repository and need to commit the changes
for multiple projects in a single atomic commit transaction.</p>

<p>There are several issues in the issue tracker that describe the
problem in more detail (see <a

#2381</a>).</p>

<h3>Operation and error logging for svnserve (<a href="http://subversion.tigris.org/issues/show_bug.cgi?id=2409"
>issue&nbsp;#2409</a>):</h3>

<p>Subversion 1.3.0 added support for operational logging in
mod_dav_svn.  That is, logging what actual client-side operations are
performed on a repository, rather than just logging the endless flow
of WebDAV requests.  Support for this kind of logging, as well as
error logging, needs to be added to the standalone svnserve daemon.
This requires some work in the APR library, which would provide the
actual logging facility.</p>

<p>This has been extensively discussed on the Subversion development
mailing list in the past.  A good first step would be to review the
previous proposals.</p>

<p><em>This task may have been started at <a

<div class="h3" id="svn-augmented-diff" title="svn-augmented-diff">
<h3>An augmented diff representation</h3>

<p>Currently, 'svn diff' outputs a patch in the so-called "Unified
diff" format.  The problem is, this format is fairly old, and as such
can represent only textual differences between files.  It does not
represent structural changes to the directory tree, nor can it
encompass changes to various metadata, the kind used extremely
frequently by Subversion.</p>

<p>'svn diff' actually has two or three use cases.  The first is to
produce a human-reviewable description of a change suitable for code
review.  The second (and maybe third) are to produce a file that can
be sent by email or stored somewhere for later application, by patch(1)
(the second use case) or some other more-capable patch tool (the third
use case).  Of these, 'svn diff' currently only supports the first case.
For example, copied files are currently shown as differences against the
original version of the file, which makes review easier, though isn't
suitable for applying with patch.</p>

<p>This task is: First, to propose a solution for serialising a complete
representation of a change.  Then, implement that solution with a new
switch to 'svn diff' and a new subcommand ('svn patch'?) that would
apply a previously created serialised patch.</p>

<p>Things to consider in your design of the serialisation format:</p>
<ul>
<li>Whether it represents content diffs in a human-readable format
(probably using the unified diff format), Subversion's native binary
delta format, or some other format.  Considerations include non-precise
(fuzzy) patching and representing changes to binary files.</li>
<li>Whether it should be compatible (to some degree) with patch(1)
(by encoding extra information in a "garbage" chunk of data that patch
will ignore, similar to the way property changes are reported today).</li>
<li>How renames (when eventually implemented as a primitive operation)
should be represented.</li>
</ul>

<p>Note that <a href="http://svk.elixus.org">SVK</a> posesses such a
rich unified diff format.  It may or may not be desirable to reuse the
same kind of representation; that decision is part of the task!</p>

<h3>Issue Management</h3>

<p>Do we need an Issue Manager?  Maybe...</p>

<p>The Subversion <a
href="http://subversion.tigris.org/issue-tracker.html">bug
database</a> has been managed in a rather ad hoc fashion thus far.
Periodically we make sweeps over all outstanding issues and try to
prioritize them, organize them into scheduled milestones, note
dependencies between issues, etc.  These methods have been moderately
successful up till now, but they are not scaling well as the number of
issues grows.  Since issue growth is proportional to user base growth,
the issue tracker is becoming a victim of Subversion's success.  We
need to find new ways of managing our issues, ways that do not involve
making O(N) sweeps over the entire list of open issues at regular
intervals.</p>

<p>While we have some semi-formalized management roles (patch manager,
release manager, etc), we have never had an issue manager.  It might
be time to get one, though.  It's not yet clear whether the problem is
mainly one of attention, or of algorithm, or both, but having someone
dedicated to managing the issues database couldn't hurt.  One thing
such a person could do would be to go through the list of outstanding
issues, figure out which ones are likely to be <a
href="#bite-sized">bite-sized tasks</a>, and mark them as such, so
that other volunteers have an easier time choosing things to work on.
We've already marked various issues as bite-sized, but we haven't done
so consistently as new issues come in.  This means there are a lot of
potential entry points to the project going unnoticed.  Want to help
us solve that?</p>

<h2>Bite-Sized Coding Tasks</h2>

<p>The Subversion bug database contains many issues classified as
"bite-sized" tasks&nbsp;&mdash;&nbsp;tasks that are well-defined and
self-contained, and thus suitable for a volunteer looking to get
involved with the project.  You <i>don't</i> need broad or detailed
knowledge of Subversion's design to take on one of these, just a
pretty good idea of how things generally work, and familiarity with
the coding guidelines in the
<a href="hacking.html">Hacker's Guide to Subversion</a>.  Many tasks
are things a volunteer could pick off in a spare week or two, and
they're a great way to start learning your way around the Subversion
code.</p>

<p> If you start one of these tasks, please notify the other
developers by marking the issue as "STARTED" in the issue tracker,
then mail <a

<div class="h2" id="bindings" title="bindings">
<h2>Improved Bindings to Other Languages</h2>

<p>One of Subversion's strengths is that it offers a rich set of
"binding surfaces": well-documented APIs that are available not only
in C (Subversion's native language) but in other programming languages
as well (see the <a
 href="links.html#lang_bindings">complete list</a>).</p>

<p>Some of these language bindings are maintained via <a
href="http://www.swig.org/">SWIG</a>, a tool that partially automates
the process of generating bindings, while others are maintained by
hand.  Many of the bindings do not have complete coverage yet, or have
interface problems where they do have coverage.  So even though
they're used in many production systems, there's still plenty of work
to do.  Specifically:</p>

<ul>

<li><p>The <a
href="http://svn.collab.net/repos/svn/trunk/subversion/bindings/swig/python/"
>SWIG/Python bindings</a> are in pretty good shape, but their coverage
is not yet complete.  Help is welcome.</p></li>

<li><p>Our <a
href="http://svn.collab.net/repos/svn/trunk/subversion/bindings/java/javahl/"
>Java</a>, <a
href="http://svn.collab.net/repos/svn/trunk/subversion/bindings/swig/perl/"
>SWIG/Perl</a>, and <a
href="http://svn.collab.net/repos/svn/trunk/subversion/bindings/swig/ruby/"
>SWIG/Ruby</a> bindings are in pretty good shape, but maybe there are
other languages you'd like to call Subversion APIs from?  Lisp/Scheme?
Feel free to start a new bindings project, if you don't see what you
need here.</p></li>
