<h2>Upcoming Releases</h2>

<p>This is a <em>preliminary</em> timetable for the next few upcoming
releases.  As noted above, we do not guarantee that a specific feature will
be in a given release, or that a release will be published on a particular
schedule.  The following chart is more of a guideline for the developers
to help ensure more timely releases, and is quite mutable.</p>

<h2>How We Plan Releases</h2>

<p>Subversion uses a compromise between time-driven and feature-driven
release planning.  We schedule the next release for an approximate
date (very approximate), and make sure it contains one or more new
features or other significant differentiators, but we don't say
exactly what those new features will be.  This is because we're always
working on several things at once, and we want to give each new
feature time to mature.  Especially given the decentralized nature of
open-source development, we're wary of forcing technical discussions
to premature consensus.  At the same time, it's good for the project
to have regular releases, so we try to keep to a schedule and to
have <i>something</i> ready to roll out when the release date comes
along.</p>

<p>In this context, "release" means an increment of the minor release
number, which is the middle number in our three-component system.
Thus, 1.2.0, 1.3.0, and 1.4.0 are successive minor releases in the
"1.x" line, whereas 1.1.1, 1.1.2, and 1.1.3 are successive patch
(bugfix) releases in the "1.1.x" line.  We don't schedule patch
releases far in advance, we just put them out when we feel enough
bugfixes have accumulated to warrant it.  Major new releases, such as
Subversion 2.0, will probably be done much like the minor releases,
just with more planning around the exact features.  For more
information about Subversion's release numbering and compatibility
policies, see the section entitled <i>"Release numbering,
compatibility, and deprecation"</i> in the
<a href="hacking.html">Hacker's Guide to Subversion</a>.</p>

<div class="h2" id="upcoming-features" title="upcoming-features">
<h2>Upcoming Features</h2>

<p>We try to have at least one or two new features under active
development at any given time, but we generally don't rush a feature
to get it into a release.  The flexibly time-driven model <a
href="#release-planning">described above</a> means there's never a
long wait between releases, which in turn means less pressure to cram
a feature into whatever release happens to be going out the door next.
Our main source of ideas is our users: we watch the <a
href="mailto:users@subversion.tigris.org"
>users@subversion.tigris.org</a> mailing list, the <a
href="irc://irc.freenode.net/#svn">#svn IRC channel</a>, and the <a
href="issue-tracker.html">issue tracker</a> to see what people are
saying, and base our priorities on that, though we may sometimes grab
low-hanging fruit along the way.</p>

<p>Below are new features currently under discussion and design, as
extracted from the ever-changing consensus of the Subversion developer
community.  Because this is a volunteer open-source project, it's hard
to predict exact dates or timetables for these new features.  At most,
we can express dependencies and predict the order in which things will
be worked on.  <em>Just because a feature is listed for a particular
release does not guarantee that it will be in that release.</em>  Hard
feature lists don't actually get set until the <a
href="release-process.html#release-branches">release branch</a> is
created.  The best way to track development is to <a
href="/servlets/ProjectMailingListList">subscribe</a> to the
development mailing list, <a href="mailto:dev@subversion.tigris.org"
>dev@subversion.tigris.org</a>.</p>
