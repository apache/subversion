We use the "Buddy System" for filing issues.<br />
Before filing a new issue, please:
</p>

<ul>

  <li><p>Re-read the documentation<br />
      <span style="font-size: 75%; font-weight: normal">
      (especially the <a href="faq.html">FAQ</a> and the
      online <a href="http://svnbook.red-bean.com/"
      >Subversion book</a>).</span></p></li>

  <li><p>Look through <a
      href="http://subversion.tigris.org/issues/buglist.cgi?component=subversion&amp;issue_status=UNCONFIRMED&amp;issue_status=NEW&amp;issue_status=STARTED&amp;issue_status=REOPENED"
      >all existing issues</a>, or search their summaries:</p>

      </div></form>
      <p style="font-size: 75%; font-weight: normal">
      to see if this bug has already been reported.</p></li>

  <li><p>Find someone else who agrees this is a bug.<br />
      <span style="font-size: 75%; font-weight: normal">
      Post to the <a href="mailto:users@subversion.tigris.org"
      >users@subversion.tigris.org</a> mailing list (or to
      <a href="mailto:dev@subversion.tigris.org"
      >dev@subversion.tigris.org</a> if you're already pretty sure
      it's a bug), or chat in <a href="irc://irc.freenode.net/#svn"
      >IRC</a>, regarding the bug or feature request you were about to
      file.  People there will ask you questions, try to reproduce the
      problem, advise you if there's any past history of similar
      problems, and in general help you decide whether a new issue is
      warranted.  If it is, they can also help you get the bug report
      into a useful form.  See <a href="bugs.html">here</a> for how to
      write a useful bug report.</span></p>

      <p><span style="font-size: 75%; font-weight: normal">If you do
      file an issue, <i>remember to include a link to the mailing list
      message(s) or IRC conversation where you discussed the problem</i>.
      Not only does this provide important context for anyone reading
      the issue, it also confirms that the issue has passed the basic
      buddy test: you found someone else who agrees it's a problem.
      Issues that haven't been through the "buddy system" may be
      summarily closed.  We're sorry to do this, but statistically,
      most unbuddied filings turn out to be bogus, and the issue
      tracker is not a convenient place to separate the good reports
      from the bad.</span></p></li>

</ul>

<p>We depend on the mailing list and IRC channel as a first level of
filtering for our bug tracker.  Without this filtering, the tracker
would be full of duplicate issues, non-issues, and unreproducible
issues.  Please help us keep the bug database clean, by always finding
a buddy before you file!</p>

</div>

<p>When mailing the list with a concern, make sure that your e-mail
   describes your bug or enhancement fully.  Provide details about the
   versions of the relevant software (Subversion, Apache, neon, etc.)
   that you are using, about your operating system, and about any
   other thing that might seem pertinent to the issue.  If you can
   provide a script which consistently reproduces a problem, that can
   be incredibly helpful to those evaluating and/or working on your
   issue.</p>

<h3>Filing New Issues, Modifying Existing Issues</h3>

<p>You must be logged in to the web site to add a new issue, and you must
be logged in with the <em>Observer</em> role in the Subversion project
to modify an existing issue&nbsp;&mdash;&nbsp;even one that you
created yourself.</p>

<p>Here's how to acquire the <em>Observer</em> role:</p>

<ol>
  <li>Log in on the tigris.org site</li>
  <li>Go to the Subversion project front page</li>
  <li>Click on the <em>Request project role</em> link directly below the
    &quot;Project Home&quot; line</li>
  <li>Request the <em>Observer</em> role</li>
  <li>Wait for the confirmation e-mail</li>
</ol>

<div class="h3" id="fields" title="fields">
<h3>What the Issue Fields Mean</h3>

<p>When an issue is first filed, it automatically goes in the
<b>"---"</b> target milestone, which indicates that the issue has not
yet been processed.  A developer will examine it and maybe talk to
other developers, then estimate the bug's severity, the effort
required to fix it, and schedule it in a numbered milestone, for
example <b><a
href="http://subversion.tigris.org/issues/buglist.cgi?target_milestone=1.1"
>1.1</a></b>.  (Or they may put it the <b><a
href="http://subversion.tigris.org/issues/buglist.cgi?target_milestone=unscheduled"
>unscheduled</a></b> or <b><a
href="http://subversion.tigris.org/issues/buglist.cgi?target_milestone=nonblocking"
>nonblocking</a></b> milestone, if they consider it tolerable for all
currently planned releases.)  </p>

<p> An issue filed in <b>unscheduled</b> might still get fixed soon,
if some committer decides they want it done.  Putting it in
<b>unscheduled</b> merely means it hasn't been scheduled for any
particular release yet.  The <b>nonblocking</b> milestone, on the
other hand, means that we do not anticipate ever scheduling the issue
for a particular release.  This also does not mean the issue will
never be fixed; it merely means that we don't plan to block any
release on it.</p>

<p>
Severity is represented in the <b>Priority</b> field.  Here is how
priority numbers map to severity:
</p>

<ul>

   <li><b>P1:</b> <i>Prevents work from getting done, causes data
         loss, or BFI ("Bad First Impression" -- too embarrassing for
         a 1.0 release).</i>
   </li>

   <li><b>P2:</b> <i>Workaround required to get stuff done.</i>
   </li>

   <li><b>P3:</b> <i>Like P2, but rarely encountered in normal usage.</i>
   </li>

   <li><b>P4:</b> <i>Developer concern only, API stability or
         cleanliness issue.</i>
   </li>

   <li><b>P5:</b> <i>Nice to fix, but in a pinch we could live with it.</i>
   </li>

</ul>

<p>
Effort Required is represented in the <b>Status Whiteboard</b> with an
"<b>e number</b>", which is the average of the most optimistic and
most pessimistic projections for number of engineer/days needed to
fix the bug.  The e number always comes first, so we can sort on the
field, but we include the actual spread after it, so we know when
we're dealing with a wide range.  For example
"<b>e2.5&nbsp;(2&nbsp;/&nbsp;3)</b>" is not quite the same as 
"<b>e2.5&nbsp;(1&nbsp;/&nbsp;4)</b>"!</p>
