To install Subversion for the first time, you may be able to get a
pre-built binary package for your operating system; visit the <a
href="project_packages.html">Packaged Distributions</a> page to see if
this option is available for you.  If not, or if you prefer to build
from a source release, then:

<ol>

   <li><p>Download the latest tarball distribution from the <a
   href="http://subversion.tigris.org/servlets/ProjectDownloadList?folderID=260">Source Releases Area</a>.</p></li>

   <li><p>Build and install it according to the instructions in the
   <a href="http://svn.collab.net/repos/svn/trunk/INSTALL">INSTALL</a>
   file in the top level of the distribution.  You will end up with a
   'svn' binary in the subversion/clients/cmdline/ directory (or
   installed in /usr/local/bin/, if you ran 'make install'.)</p></li>

</ol>

<p> Now you have the latest released version of Subversion installed.
Read the <a href="http://svnbook.red-bean.com">Subversion Book</a> to
learn how to use Subversion, and to see how it differs from CVS.

<p>If you want stability, you can stop here, and just upgrade as new
releases come out.  If you prefer to stay current with Subversion
development, then use your newly-installed Subversion client to check
out a working copy of the master sources:</p>

<pre>
   $ svn co http://svn.collab.net/repos/svn/trunk subversion
</pre>

<p>That will get you a new working copy directory named
<code>subversion/</code>, containing the latest sources.  (If you're
behind a proxy or have problems with the checkout, see the <a
href="project_faq.html#proxy">proxy faq</a>.)  Read the <a
href="http://svn.collab.net/repos/svn/trunk/INSTALL">INSTALL</a> file
for instructions on building in the working copy, which differs
slightly from building a released tarball.

<p>See the <a
href="http://subversion.tigris.org/inconveniences.html">Warnings and
Inconveniences Page</a> for the most annoying bugs and their
workarounds; see the <a
href="http://subversion.tigris.org/project_issues.html">Issue
Tracker</a> for a complete list of known bugs, and instructions on
filing new bugs.</p>
