12. While I had a few problems at first, they were either caused by

    or
	B) My own stupid mistakes like making a backup of a folder BEFORE
       doing a svn delete of it and then after the delete copying the
       backup back and then wondering why svn update was failing.

12. Thornhaven is a mud (online multiplayer game, text based), a work
    in progress, based on the Theta MUD engine. For the past two
    years, the Theta engine hasn't been under version control (as it
    was just me, it was more effort than it was worth), but recently
    as the project has been speeding up, I've put it under version
    control. I first considered CVS, but I'm glad I didn't... svn is
    quite good, even at this pre-release stage.
