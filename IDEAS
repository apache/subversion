* shell-like interactive mode for client (like ftp)

  Subject: A feature request for command line client
  To: dev@subversion.tigris.org
  Date: Tue, 17 Oct 2000 09:46:58 -0700
  
  I know people are beginning to work on the command line client, so I
  hope Im not too late with this request.
  
  Basically I would like svn to behave like ftp (actually more like lftp
  or ncftp).
  
  What this means is that if you type just "svn<return>" you get dropped
  into an interactive svn shell where you can type a litany of commands.
  Preferably this happens without relogging into the server etc.
  
  Example:
  
  cavanaug@lajolla ~ 1%  svn
  
  svn> status foo.c
  
    output of command
  
  svn> commit bar.h
  
    output of command
  
  svn> cd subdir
  svn> status README
  
    output of command
  
  svn> quit
  
  cavanaug@lajolla ~ 2%  svn
  
  Personally I think this is a really convenient way to operate
  interactively on a directory without having to continually re-run the
  svn client.
  
  Plus this is method is a godsend if you want to write scripts that
  automate svn. (ie. Perhaps like the cvs2svn or xxx2svn)

** Command-line editing libraries with more liberal licenses

   From: Dave Glowacki <dglo@ssec.wisc.edu>
   
   <snip>
   
   There's 'getline', which doesn't have all of readline's features,
   but which does basic editing.  ncftp and tin can be built with
   getline instead of readline, so it does a decent enough job.
   
   You can find it at ftp://ftp.sco.com/skunkware/src/lib/getline-39-src.tar.gz

   When integrating Subversion support into Emacs vc-mode, using the

  I agree, and I also support Jonathan Shapiro's idea that a

  well.)
  
  That way, Subversion can have its own options (-r instead of -R)
  and not have to worry about the CVS cruft like '-d' meaning one
  thing as a global option and another thing as a command option.

* svndiff encoders/decoders

  A shell script or elisp to encode/decode/view base64-svndiff data?

               "M-x svn-decode-region" (displays the data and opcodes)
               etc
  Not crucial, just development and debugging help.


* split libsvn_WC into two components

  split into: one for managing the metadata (the stuff in ./SVN/), and one
  for the rest of the WC functionality (crawling and updating). This would
  provide a way to use multiple metadata storage and management options,
  possibly optimized for the platform at hand.

  Alternate storage options: separate file streams (NTFS streams, MacOS
  resource forks), a single database of data (rather than per-dir), or
  server-based storage (via DeltaV)

  Benefit of a single database: apps/systems that nuke a directory and 
  rewrite it will no longer "unhook" the working copy from SVN (since
  the data is stored elsewhere). Fred Sanchez has pointed out this
  could be important for MacOS Bundles (the OS nukes and rebuilds
  subdirs, taking the CVS/ or SVN/ subdir with it)

  Benefit of a "true" database: there is a lot of effort expended in
  the current libsvn_wc to transact the changes, record logs of
  changes, and to perform them in an atomic manner. A transacted
  database on the client side could potentially simplify much of that
  work (and the corresponding I/O to track it).


* Server side project policy enforcement

  From: Branko Cibej <brane@xbc.nu>
  Date: Mon, 23 Oct 2000 18:37:49 +0200
  
  I'd be quite happy if we could "promise" that someday it'll be possible
  to write a script on the SVN server side to, e.g., reject an export
  if an explicit tag wasn't supplied; or reject a commit if there were
  merge conflicts; etc., etc. Then all of this boils down to putting
  examples into contrib/ (once we have it).

* svn sync

  Imagine an intelligent update that knows to add new files and remove
  files that you've removed, and all recursively (without having to svn
  add, svn rm, ad nauseam).

  So, for example, you've got:
  
  $ ls -1
    foo.c
    bar.c
  
  $ touch qux
  $ touch qux/fizzle
  $ touch qux/smootch
  
  $svn up
    ? qux
    M foo.c
  
  $ rm bar.c
  
  *
  
  $ svn sync
    A qux
    A qux/fizzle
    A qux/smootch
    M foo.c
    R bar.c
    
  $ svn ci -m "Boy have I been busy."
    ...
  
  * Note, that if you were to do an update at this point, bar.c would be
    pulled from the repository

* Reserved and unreserved checkouts

  Brian Behlendorf <brian@collab.net> writes:
  > I would also ask that reserved checkouts not be made impossible to

   Oh, not to worry -- nothing in the current design makes them
  impossible to implement later.  It's a matter of the repository
  keeping records about who has checked out what, that's all.

  To prove that it's not a problem, here's an implementation:

     1. Client A requests a reserved checkout of tree T

     2. Server sets a non-historical property on T noting that client
        has reserved it and sends T to client.

     3. Client B tries to commit to T, the commit fails because the
        repository notices the property.

     4. Client A releases the reservation.  Server removes the
        non-historical property.

     5. Client B commits and succeeds.

  With a flexible server-side hook interface, such as Subversion will
  have, you don't even need much (any?) extra code in Subversion itself
  to support this.

  [snip]
  As for user interface thingies ... Off the top of my head I'd propose
  something like this, given the following commands: get, update, commit
  checkout, checkin:

    get:
        create working copy, making files writable or not depending
        on each file's reserved-checkout policy;

    update:
        update the WC, with same behaviour WRT file flags;

    commit:
        commit changes in the usual way, /without/ changing
        file flags or lock status;

    checkout:
        update, and for files with unreserved checkout policy,
        lock it and make it writable; With appropriate permissions,
        can override the file's checkout policy (with a flag) until
        the next checkin;

    checkin:
        commit, and if it was locked, unlock it and set the file
        flag according to the file's checkout policy (meaning that
        it might become readonly, or it might not).

  Note that when I say "file", I should in fact say "object version".
  You might want to allow unreserved checkouts on files, for instance,
  but require reserved checkouts for directories when adding new
  objects.


Notice that we get paired commands: `update' vs. `checkout', `commit'
vs. `checkin'. This means that `checkout' and `checkin' should behave
like `update' and `commit', respectively, on files with unreserved
checkout policy. Maybe we don't even need pairs of commands, just a
flag for `update' to change the checkout policy for the current update?

Maybe `status' should show locks on files? Perhaps another command
would be better for that, so as not to slow down `status'. Should
show a) locks on working-copy branch; b) locks on all branches.

Users with appropriate privileges would be allowed to break locks.

  Notice what I said above: "After an update, of course."

  I see it working like this: when update detects a conflict, it stores
  the current repository version of the file somewhere in the admin
  directory, probably near the stored original version. Status would
  just look if that locally stored version exists, and subsequent
  updates would pull in a new version, or remove it if the conflict goes
  away. Extra bonus: you can do a three-way merge locally.

  a) You don't have to do an update to check if you currently have any
  conflics; b) you can still compile in the local copy without tripping
  over those wakas; c) works well for binary files that can have special
  merge tools; d) etcetera ad nauseam.


Here's how `update', `status' and `commit' could cooperate:

    update:
        If there is a conflict, put the text of the current repository
        version into SVN/conflicts. Could also store a diff against
        the pristine copy in SVN/text-base, instead.

        If a conflict is resolved by a later update, remove the entry
        in SVN/conflicts.

    status:
        Report `C' instead of `M' if the entry in SVN/conflicts
        exists. This operation is completely local.

    commit:
        Refuse commit if there is a conflict. Should not do only a
        local check, as the user may have resolved the conflict in
        the meantime. If successful, remove the entry in
        SVN/conflicts.

        Could have a --force flag to force the commit anyway; could
        allow or forbid --force based on user privileges or repository
        policy.


Declaring a "pure" merge (see list archives, can't find that thread
right now) could remove the entry in SVN/conflicts, too.

* convert functionality (JimB's idea)

  provide a svn command to add versioning metadata (SVN directories
  and whatnot) to a local directory tree that is (presumably) the
  equivalent of a working copy without the SVN directories.
  
  svn convert local-dir repository
  
  Did I get that right? -Fitz

* repository commands
  
  the ability to do repository operations from the client via the 'svn
  repo' subcommand. 

* use a format string to construct ``svn status'' output

  Because `svn status' seems like a very convenient vehicle for
  supplying arbitrary information that a script may wish to extract.
  What if `svn status' had a standard, default display that was
  configured with a format string.  That format string could be
  over-ridden with an option (``--format=....'') and we made an
  option alias or two for formats that were likely to be commonly
  used?  Here is an approximation that would likely be abbreviated:
  
     --format="%{obj-name}:  %{ver=TAG} vs. %{local-ver} is %{mod-state}\n"
  
  So, if TAG were associated with the 1234 version of object mumble,
  but the local copy were version 1222 but unchanged, you get:
  
    mumble:  1234 vs. 1222 is unchanged
  - Bruce

* Interoperate with CVS servers

Create libsvn_ra_cvs (client mode only, maybe just :pserver: and :ext:,
and possibly :fork: for accessing local repositories).

This will let a Subversion client pull modules directly out of CVS
repositories. Could be very interesting in combination with
configuration nodes in the SVN filesystem.

Rationale: Don't expect all the world to switch to SVN after 1.0. And
we'll still want to pull APR into the SVN working copy, so this would
be a direct benefit to the project (once /we/ switch).

Question; Would it be better to pull the code out of the CVS sources,
or write it to the CVSclient spec?

* Random access to delta-encoded files

Several features collude to produce a challenge:
- HTTP provides the ability to fetch substrings of files.
- Subversion provides a uniform interface for reading both old and new
  versions of nodes.
- Subversion wants to use deltas to store multiple versions of a file
  in a compact way.

So, suppose an HTTP request comes in for bytes 1,000,000,000 through
1,000,004,000 of a two-gigabyte file, which happens to be stored in
the repository as the result of applying ten deltas to another
two-gigabyte file which is stored in fulltext.  It would be nice if it
were possible to extract the requested bytes without reconstructing
the full text of the file.

In other words, we'd like random access to the result of applying a
text delta to some source string.

I was thinking of extending the svndelta format with a hierarchical
index, a B+tree of delta windows: after every tenth window, store a
little table of pointers to the windows.  After every tenth little
table, store a little table of pointers to little tables of pointers
to windows.  After every tenth... you see what I mean.  Then you can
start at the end of the file and find any window in logarithmic time.
That procedure always emits balanced trees.  Use 100 instead of ten,
and your tree has 1/100th the number of nodes as your file has
windows, and is very shallow.

* Removing obsolete versions to archive

A project repository can grow huge over several years. Would be nice
to have a way to move obsolete data to archive or offline
storage. Some possibilities:

  - Move just the file text offline (e.g., support "offline" file
    nodes in addition to full-text and delta storage), but keep
    history and filesystem metadata intact. We can do this with the
    current filesystem design.

  - Remove whole branches or parts of branches (this could mean whole
    nodes) from the filesystem. The current filesystem design does not
    support this; right now we could do that by copying part of the
    repository (via xml export?) to a new database and removing the
    old one, but that would change node numbers and filesystem
    revision numbers, which we probably don't want.

  Brane Cibej <brane@xbc.nu>

* Revise the editor interface to use paths rather than components?

Either revise the interface itself to pass around complete paths [from 
the root], or possibly have a "wrapping editor" that assembles paths
and calls a secondary editor interface which uses the path-style
API. The wrapping editor would have something like:

    struct dir_baton {
      svn_string_t *path;
      void *user_dir_baton;
      struct edit_baton *edit_baton;
    }

    change_dir_prop(void *baton, ...)
    {
      struct dir_baton *my_baton = baton;
      delta_fns_t editor = my_baton->edit_baton->editor;

      (*editor->change_dir_prop)(my_baton->user_dir_baton, ...);
    }

This idea is premised on the number of editors that compose the
components into larger paths before working on them. Depending on
whether that is "typical", switching the interface might be
interesting.
