.SH SYNOPSIS
.B @PACKAGE@
[
.I options\c
\&.\|.\|.\& ]
.SH DESCRIPTION
Runs Subversion's
.B svnserve
program in tunnel mode, setting the tunnel username equal to the
username of the user that invoked
.BR @PACKAGE@ .

Using this wrapper, repository administrators can have meaningful
path-based access controls when using the svn+ssh access scheme
without resorting to the authorized_keys trick.  Normally, the svn+ssh
scheme requires the repository administrator to make all repository
files fully readable and writeable by all users.  Unfortunately, this
configuration allows users to easily bypass
.BR svnserve 's
access controls.  With
.B svnstsw
installed and the setuid or setgid bit set, repository administrators
can take direct filesystem access away from users and prevent them
from bypassing
.BR svnserve 's
access controls.

This wrapper works by executing (via
.BR exec (3))
.B svnserve
with the
.B \-\-tunnel
and
.BI \-\-tunnel\-user= user
arguments, where
.I user
is the username of the user that invoked
.B svnstsw
(as determined using either
.BR getlogin_r (3)
or
.BR getpwuid_r (3)
with
.BR getuid (3)).

The specific
.B svnserve
executable to run is set at compile time and can be verified using the
.B \-\-help
command-line argument.

The
.B \-\-root=\c
.I path
command-line argument is also passed to
.B svnserve\c
, with the value of
.I path
set at compile time.  The value of
.I path
can be verified using the
.B \-\-help
command-line argument.  Depending on compile-time settings,
.I path
may be overridden using the
.B \-r
or
.B \-\-root
command-line arguments; see
.B \-\-help
for more details.

This wrapper was written for Subversion 1.4.
.SH OPTIONS
.TP
.BR \-h , \ \-\-help
Display a command-line usage summary along with the specific
.B svnserve
binary to execute and the (default) virtual repository root path.
.TP
.BI \-r " path\fR,\fP " \-\-root= path
Use
.I path
as the argument to
.B svnserve\c
\&'s
.B --root
command-line argument instead of the compiled-in default.  This option
is ignored if root overriding was disabled at compile time.  To see
the default
.I path\c
, use the
.B \-\-help
option.
.TP
.BR \-R , \ \-\-read\-only
Instructs this wrapper to also pass the
.B \-\-read\-only
command-line argument to
.B svnserve\c
\&.
.TP
.BR \-t , \ \-\-tunnel
Ignored.
.TP
.BI \-\-tunnel-user= user
