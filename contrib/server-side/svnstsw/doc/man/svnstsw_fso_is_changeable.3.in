.SH NAME
@PACKAGE@_fso_is_changeable \- test if a file or directory is
changeable
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B #include <@PACKAGE@/fso_is_changeable.h>

.BI "int @PACKAGE@_fso_is_changeable(const char* " path ");"
.SH DESCRIPTION
Tests if the file or directory referred to by
.I path
is changeable.  A file or directory is considered changeable if it can
be directly modified or if any component of the path can be renamed.
If any component of the path refers to a symbolic link, the target is
also tested.  Permissions are tested against the real user and group
IDs, not the effective IDs.

This function is designed to help determine whether a file is safe to
.BR exec (3)
from a setuid/setgid binary.  If this function returns true, the user
may be able to start a shell as the effective user.

This function is thread-safe if the user's C POSIX library is
thread-safe.
.SH ARGUMENTS
.TP
.I path
Null-terminated string containing the path to the file or directory to
test.
.SH RETURN VALUE
On success, returns 1 if the user (real user and group IDs) can change
the file or directory referred to by
.IR path ,
or 0 if the file or directory can not be changed.

On error, returns 1 and sets
.I errno
(see 
.BR errno (3)).
.SH ERRORS
Error conditions and
.I errno
(see
.BR errno (3))
values are described in the specifications for
.BR stat "(3), " access "(3), " snprintf "(3), " lstat "(3), " readlink "(3), and " getcwd "(3)."
